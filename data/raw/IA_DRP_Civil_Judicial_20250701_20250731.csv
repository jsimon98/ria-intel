NAVELLIER APPEALED TO THE FIRST CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE STATEMENT IN NAI'S MARKETING MATERIAL WAS TRUE, AND THAT THE  INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND GAINS WERE LEGITIMATELY EARNED BY NAI. IN FACT, THE SUPPOSEDLY ""DEFRAUDED"" NAI CLIENTS GOT EXACTLY THE INVESTMENT ADVICE THEY HIRED NAI TO PROVIDE, SUFFERRED NO PECUNIARY HARM, AND RECEIVED OVER $221 MILLION IN PROFITS FROM NAI'S VIREO INVESTMENT ADVICE. ON JULY 16, 2024, THE FIRST CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURT'S JUDGMENT BY MISCHARACTERIZING NAI'S AND LN'S EVIDENCE, IGNORING THE LACK OF SEC EVIDENCE OF ""FRAUD"" AND OVERLOOKING THAT NAI DID HAVE SUPPORT FOR ITS TRUE STATEMENT. THEREFORE, NAI, LN, AND THEIR ATTORNEY BELIEVE THAT THE FIRST CIRCUIT'S DECISION WAS WRONG BECAUSE IT MISCONSTRUED THE LAW,  IMPROPERLY DECIDED DISPUTED FACTS WHICH A JURY SHOULD HAVE DECIDED, AND UPHELD DISGORGEMENT WHEN THE INVESTORS LOST NO MONEY AND, IN FACT, RECEIVED OVER $221 MILLION. NAI AND LN FILED A PETITION FOR REHEARING BY THE ENTIRE PANEL OF FIRST CIRCUIT JUDGES TO OVERTURN THE ERRONEOUS DECISION BECAUSE IT CONFLICTS WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S LIU DECISION AND THE SECOND CIRCUIT'S DECISION IN SEC V. GOVIL 86 F.4TH 89, 98. THE FIRST CIRCUIT EN BANC DENIED TO REHEAR AND OVERTURN THE DECISION. ON MARCH 3, 2025 LOUIS NAVELLIER AND NAI FILED A PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI IN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO OVERTURN THE FIRST CIRCUIT'S DECISION, BECAUSE IT IS WRONG AND  BECAUSE IT CONFLICTS WITH LIU AND GOVIL AND OTHER SUPREME COURT DECISIONS. THE U.S SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO HEAR THE PETITION, BUT NAI AND MR. NAVELLIER PETITIONED ON JULY 1, 2025 FOR A REHEARING ASKING THE COURT TO CONSIDER THE CASE. ON JUNE 12, 2020, THE SEC INSTITUTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS WITH THE SEC TO SANCTION OR POSSIBLY DEREGISTER NAI AND MR. NAVELLIER AND TO BAN THEM FROM BEING INVESTMENT ADVISERS. THE SEC HAS MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO BAN NAI AND MR. NAVELLIER. THEY ARE STRENUOUSLY OPPOSING THE MOTION BECAUSE THEY COMMITTED NO VIOLATIONS AND DISGORGEMENT IS NOT AUTHORIZED UNDER A CORRECT READING OF THE LIU DECISION AND UNDER GOVIL. THE MOTION IS PENDING."

WACHOVIA SECURITIES, LLC, CIVIL CASE NO. 09 CV 743 (N.D. ILL.)","","SEC LITIGATION RELEASE 20885, FEBRUARY 5, 2009: SECTION 15(C) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 - THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED A SETTLEMENT WITH WACHOVIA SECURITIES, LLC THAT WILL PROVIDE MORE THAN $7 BILLION IN LIQUIDITY TO THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS WHO INVESTED IN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ARS) BEFORE THE MARKET FOR THOSE SECURITIES COLLAPSED. THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVES THE SEC'S CHARGES THAT WACHOVIA MISLED INVESTORS REGARDING THE LIQUIDITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS THAT IT UNDERWROTE, MARKETED AND SOLD. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA AND ANOTHER FIRM, WHOSE BROKER-DEALER OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO WACHOVIA MISREPRESENTED TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARS WERE SAFE, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT WERE COMPARABLE TO CASH OR MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT, WACHOVIA REINFORCED THE PERCEPTION OF LIQUIDITY BY ROUTINELY PURCHASING ARS FROM THE OTHER FIRM'S CUSTOMERS BETWEEN AUCTIONS, WITHOUT TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT WACHOVIA'S WILLINGNESS TO DO SO DEPENDED UPON THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE AUCTIONS. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA BECAME AWARE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT PUT THE FIRM ON NOTICE THAT THE RISK OF AUCTION FAILURES HAD MATERIALLY INCREASED. WACHOVIA, NEVERTHELESS, CONTINUED TO MARKET ARS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AS HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS. WACHOVIA FOLLOWED THE LEAD OF OTHER BROKER-DEALERS AND DECIDED TO STOP SUPPORTING AUCTIONS. WITHOUT BROKER-DEALER SUPPORT, ARS AUCTIONS FAILED AND THOUSANDS OF WACHOVIA'S CUSTOMERS WERE LEFT HOLDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ILLIQUID ARS, WITHOUT ANY PRACTICAL MEANS OF REDEEMING, SELLING OR DERIVING VALUE FROM THEM.","Final","","","N","","Judgment Rendered","02/17/2009","Y","","","","","","","","Y","","UNDERTAKINGS: THE SETTLEMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL, PROVIDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT: WACHOVIA WILL OFFER TO BUY BACK ARS FROM ALL INVESTORS WHO PURCHASED ARS FROM WACHOVIA INTO ACCOUNTS MAINTAINED AT WACHOVIA ON OR BEFORE FEB. 13, 2008. WACHOVIA'S BUYBACK HAS TWO PHASES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, WHICH ENDED ON NOV. 28, 2008, WACHOVIA OFFERED TO PURCHASE ARS HELD BY NATURAL PERSONS, NOT-FOR-PROFIT AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR OTHER ACCOUNTS WITH ACCOUNT VALUES OR HOUSEHOLD VALUES UP TO $10 MILLION.

WACHOVIA WILL PAY CUSTOMERS WHO SOLD THEIR ARS BELOW PAR BETWEEN FEB. 13, 2008, AND NOV. 10, 2008, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PAR AND THE SALE PRICE OF THE ARS, PLUS REASONABLE INTEREST. WACHOVIA WILL COMPENSATE CUSTOMERS WHO TOOK OUT LOANS FROM WACHOVIA AFTER FEB. 13, 2008, BECAUSE OF LIQUIDITY CONCERNS BY REIMBURSING CUSTOMERS FOR NO LESS THAN THE NEGATIVE CARRY ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SUCH LOANS. WACHOVIA WILL OFFER TO LEND ITS CUSTOMERS THE FULL PAR VALUE OF THEIR ARS, PENDING THE CONTEMPLATED BUYBACK, WITH INTEREST RATES SET SO THAT CUSTOMERS WILL HAVE NO NEGATIVE CARRY ON THEIR LOANS.
