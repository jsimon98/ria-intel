I THEN COMMUNICATED WITH THE CUSTOMER THINKING I WAS REGISTERED IN NEW MEXICO, BUT IT TURNED OUT THAT MY REGISTRATION DID NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL LATER.  I WAS FULLY REGISTERED IN NEW MEXICO BEFORE I EXECUTED MY FIRST TRADE WITH THE CUSTOMER, SO THE DISCLOSURE ABOVE, THAT I USED ANOTHER BROKER'S REGISTRATION NUMBER IN EXECUTING A TRADE, IS INCORRECT. NEVERTHELESS, THE NASD FOUND THAT MY COMMUNICATION WITH THE CUSTOMER BEFORE MY OWN REGISTRATION WAS EFFECTIVE WAS A VIOLATION AND THAT MY INSISTENCE THAT I WAS REGISTERED AMOUNTED TO LYING TO THE NASD ABOUT IT.  THE NASD OFFERED TO SETTLE FOR A MILD 30-DAY SUSPENSION AND A $10,000 FINE, SHOWING THAT THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED A SERIOUS VIOLATION AT THE TIME.  WE REJECTED THE SETTLEMENT ONLY BECAUSE MY ATTORNEY ADVISED ME THAT THE NASD HAD A WEAK CASE AND THAT I SHOULD FIGHT IT.  UNFORTUNATELY, I LOST, AND THEN COULD NOT AFFORD TO APPEAL IT. THE CURRENT BAR IS THE CONTINUING CONSEQUENCE OF A BAD TRIAL DECISION.  UNTIL THEN, I ONLY HAD ONE CUSTOMER COMPLAINT FOR FAILING TO EXECUTE A TRADE THAT RESULTED IN A LOSS OF UNDER $200.
