It has one general partner, Bridgewater Associates Intermediate Holdings, LP (""Intermediate Holdings""), a Delaware limited partnership, and two Limited Partners, Intermediate Holdings and Bridgewater Partner, LLC (""Bridgewater Partner""), a Delaware limited liability company. Bridgewater Partner holds a minority limited partnership interest in Bridgewater. Intermediate Holdings is the sole member of Bridgewater Partner and owns a majority interest in Bridgewater. Bridgewater Associates Holdings, LLC (""BAH LLC""), a Delaware limited liability company, is the sole General Partner and majority owner of Intermediate Holdings, and therefore the indirect majority owner of Bridgewater, as noted in Schedule B.  The Operating Board of Directors has the authority to oversee the business and operations of Bridgewater, subject to certain consent rights of Robert Prince over significant actions.  The members of the Operating Board represent various stakeholder constituencies within Bridgewater. The board is comprised of equity owners, the chief executive officer, other senior employees and outside directors.  None of Robert Prince, Robert P. Prince 2016 Revocable Trust, or any other holder of BAH LLC units is generally able to exercise unilateral control of the Bridgewater entities.

The primary investment funds and separate accounts that we manage generally invest a significant portion of their assets directly or indirectly in other pooled vehicles (referred to as ""implementation funds"") which we also manage and through which we pursue our investment strategies for our primary funds and separate accounts (e.g. cash management investments are aggregated in a liquidity fund). These implementation funds do not charge management or incentive fees, do not have investors other than the funds and accounts that we manage, and are used solely for the purpose of obtaining efficient execution of our transactional activities and for reducing administrative burdens related to our primary funds and separate accounts. The assets of these implementation funds that were contributed by the primary funds and separate accounts have not been included in our RAUM or in our amount of custodied assets since we believe that, like a master feeder arrangement, this would result in the double counting of assets that we manage and custody.    Schedule D - 5K(2): We have calculated exposures and borrowings in a manner consistent with our approach to reporting such data for private funds on Form PF.   Schedule A and B: If there is no middle name listed for an individual, then the individual does not have a middle name."

For instance, a client may request that funds be disbursed monthly to a care facility for an elderly parent, to a child’s school for tuition, or for other recurring needs. In order to protect investor interests and guard against misappropriation of funds, the “Custody Rule” requires that seven conditions be met:   1.The client provides an instruction to the qualified custodian, in writing, that includes the client’s signature, the third party’s name, and either the third party’s address or the third party’s account number at a custodian to which the transfer should be directed.  2.The client authorizes the investment adviser, in writing, either on the qualified custodian’s form or separately, to direct transfers to the third party either on a specified schedule or from time to time.  3.The client’s qualified custodian performs appropriate verification of the instruction, such as a signature review or other method to verify the client’s authorization, and provides a transfer of funds notice to the client promptly after each transfer.  4.The client has the ability to terminate or change the instruction to the client’s qualified custodian.  5.The investment adviser has no authority or ability to designate or change the identity of the third party, the address, or any other information about the third party contained in the client’s instruction.  6.The investment adviser maintains records showing that the third party is not a related party of the investment adviser or located at the same address as the investment adviser.  7.The client’s qualified custodian sends the client, in writing, an initial notice confirming the instruction and an annual notice reconfirming the instruction.  If these conditions are not met, an advisor may be subject to a surprise examination of client assets by an independent public accountant. At Cardiff Park Advisors, the assets reported in Item 9.A are held at Schwab and Fidelity and are maintained according to terms of the Custody Rule, thereby meeting these seven conditions."

2006771,"PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) completed an independence assessment to evaluate the services and relationships with BlackRock Alternatives Management, LLC (the “Adviser”) and the funds listed in Appendix A hereto (the “BlackRock Relevant funds”) that may bear on PwC’s independence under the SEC independence rules.  PwC informed the Adviser that a member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited performed a non-audit service for a portfolio company that the BlackRock Relevant funds acquired a controlling interest in Environmental 360 Solutions Inc. (“E360”). From February 16, 2023, the date the Blackrock Relevant Funds acquired E360, through March 17, 2023, such member firm was engaged to act as the sole arbitrator during a proceeding between E360 and an unrelated third-party defendant, which is inconsistent with the auditor independence rules pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(4)(x) of Regulation S-X. The total fee associated with the service was approximately $40,000, all of which was incurred prior to the acquisition.  PwC communicated the facts and circumstances surrounding this service to the Adviser, including the scope and duration of this service and the associated fees incurred by PwC. PwC also noted the identified service did not have any direct accounting impact on the financial results of the BlackRock Relevant funds. The Adviser and PwC have separately considered the impact that the service may have had on PwC’s objectivity and impartiality with respect to PwC’s audit of the BlackRock Relevant funds. After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, PwC concluded that (i) PwC is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection with their audits of the BlackRock Relevant funds’ financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2023, and (ii) a reasonable investor, knowing all the relevant facts and circumstances, would reach the same conclusion. After considering these matters, and based on the totality of the information provided, the Adviser concurred with PwC’s conclusion.  Appendix A BlackRock Global Infrastructure Fund IV A, L.P.

2006668,"For Schedule D, Section 1.F, Global Infrastructure Management, LLC and its affiliates (“GIM”) maintain a liaison office in Seoul, Korea, and certain private funds maintain a Luxembourg office for regulatory local presence requirements. GIM can provide additional information regarding these locations upon request.  For Item 5, regulatory assets under management reflect the gross aggregate value of the assets held by private funds and separately managed accounts as of year-end plus unfunded capital commitments. GIM forms special purpose vehicles to serve as the general partners or managing members of certain private funds managed by GIM and are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC letter addressed to the American Bar Association’s Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities dated October 8, 2005, as updated on January 18, 2012. From time to time, certain private funds and separately managed accounts make investments through alternative investment vehicles and holding companies (collectively “AIVs”) that GIM forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory, or other structuring reasons. The AIVs have not been separately reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), but information regarding the AIVs has been aggregated with the private funds or separately managed accounts to which they relate. Regulatory assets under management and gross asset values are estimated and unaudited and may differ materially from the final audited amounts. Certain entities recently formed or being wound down with gross asset values of zero or near zero as of year-end are not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1). However, committed capital that has not been called by certain such recently formed entities is included in the amount of regulatory assets under management in Item 5 and the information provided in Item 9. In addition, these entities are included the number of clients managed by GIM. Where applicable, regulatory assets under management and gross asset values have been converted from EURO, INR, GBP, and AUD to USD based on the 12/31/2024 Spot Rate.   In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), the total commitment amount for each private fund was used to calculate the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), a private fund’s general partner (or similar managing entity) is not counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13, and the general partner’s commitment amount is excluded when calculating the percentages for the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), where applicable, investors in a private fund who have made capital commitments but have not yet had capital called are counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), due to the structural overlap of certain private funds, separately managed accounts, and co-investment clients, GIM answered in the negative for Question 19 and indicated zero percent for Question 20 as it believes that such structural overlap does not constitute a solicitation of any such client or investment by any such client into a private fund. For purposes of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), in response to Question 28, GIM indicated “Yes” for private funds that are currently in an active fundraising period utilizing a third-party placement agent, and “No” for private funds that previously employed a third-party placement agent but whose fundraising period has ended. Global Infrastructure Partners Singapore Manager Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIM, is not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.A. This entity is a sub-manager to certain non-US private funds and separately managed accounts and receives management fees from such entities, but does not conduct any investment advisory services. GIP IV Cavalry Co-Invest II, L.P. is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). This entity is an investment-specific vehicle whose sole beneficial owner is Infra Investors II Co-Invest, L.P., a private fund listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). Global Infrastructure Partners IV-C / C2 AIV, L.P. was formed for investment structuring purposes and is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). However, its beneficial owners are investors in other Global Infrastructure Partners IV private funds, which are listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). For purposes of Item 8.A.(1), from time to time, GIM warehouses investments for certain private funds that have not been formed or have not closed when the investments are made. Once formed, GIM transfers the investments to the respective private funds pursuant to their governing documents. GIM discloses these warehousing arrangements and the corresponding risks to prospective investors within the relevant private placement memoranda. For purposes of Item 8.A.(2), certain of GIM’s principals and employees invest in the same investments as the private funds (including co-investments) through such funds’ general partner entities or dedicated “friends and family” vehicles. Certain private funds and separately managed accounts hold public securities indirectly at Caixa Bank.  For Schedule D, Section 7.A., GIM treats all BLK affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers and exempt reporting advisers as related persons. These advisers manage private funds and separately managed accounts not listed under Item 5.D. or Schedule D, Section 7.B.1. of GIM’s Form ADV. These private funds and separately managed accounts are reported on the respective Form ADVs of each related SEC- registered adviser and exempt reporting adviser.

Accordingly, AMG and BC Acquisition are not “control persons” of BCAM. AMG also holds equity interests in certain other investment advisers (“AMG Affiliates”). Each of the AMG Affiliates, including BCAM, operates autonomously and independently of AMG and of each other. Except as described in this Form ADV, BCAM does not have any business dealings with these AMG Affiliates and does not conduct any joint operations with them. BCAM carries out its asset management activity, including the exercise of investment discretion and voting rights, independent of the AMG Affiliates. The AMG Affiliates do not formulate advice for BCAM's clients and do not, in BCAM's view, present any potential conflict of interest with BCAM's clients. Consequently, individual information on each AMG Affiliate is not listed in Section 7.A. of Schedule D of Part 1A of Form ADV, unless BCAM has business dealings with certain AMG Affiliates. A list of all AMG Affiliates is available to BCAM's clients upon request."

Accordingly, such SPV looks to and relies on the Adviser’s registration with the SEC and does not submit separate Form ADVs."
2001285,"General. Registrant currently provides investment management/advisory services to: (1) investment vehicles organized as legal entities (“GCM Investment Vehicles”); (2) accounts of non-fund clients (“GCM Managed Accounts” and, together with the GCM Investment Vehicles, the “GCM Funds”); and (3) certain institutional investors.    Item 5.B(2). GRV Securities LLC (“GSLLC”), an affiliate of Registrant, is a U.S.-registered broker-dealer. Certain employees of Registrant are registered representatives of GSLLC. GSLLC serves as placement agent or distributor for, among others, certain GCM Investment Vehicles. Registrant compensates GSLLC for serving as such placement agent or distributor on an annual flat fee basis.    Item 5.F(2) - Reflects Registrant’s regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) after adjusting for investments by some GCM Funds in other GCM Funds in order to avoid double counting Registrant’s RAUM. In certain cases where Registrant has been granted discretionary investment authority over GCM Funds, the investors/participants in those GCM Funds have informally reserved the right to approve or disapprove Registrant’s investment decisions for those GCM Funds prior to the implementation of such decisions.    Item 7 - Registrant’s investment management/advisory clients consist of: the GCM Investment Vehicles, holders of GCM Managed Accounts and certain institutional investors. Investors in the GCM Investment Vehicles are not, in their capacity as such, clients of Registrant. Accordingly, except as described below, although Registrant and its affiliated broker-dealers solicit prospective investors to invest in GCM Funds for which Registrant or an affiliate of Registrant is a general partner or investment manager, Registrant and its affiliated broker-dealers do not solicit Registrant’s clients to invest in GCM Funds for which Registrant or an affiliate of Registrant is a general partner or investment manager. Registrant may from time to time cause a GCM Fund to invest (or recommend that a GCM Funds invest) all or any portion of its assets in another GCM Fund, provided, among other things, that such investments have been adequately disclosed to participants in the GCM Funds involved, if such disclosure is material under the particular facts and circumstances, or, alternatively, if such investments are made on a basis that does not involve the payment of two levels of fees to Registrant. In addition, GCM Investments Japan K.K. (“GCM Japan”), a Japanese limited liability stock company of which Registrant is the sole shareholder, is registered as a securities company in Japan with the Kanto Local Finance Bureau. GCM Japan may act as a discretionary investment manager on behalf of its clients in Japan and, in that connection, may allocate its client assets to one or more GCM Funds.    Item 8.g(1). Registrant does not separately compensate financial intermediaries for the provision of non-execution related services and Registrant does not believe that it “pays up” for such services. However, Registrant may from time to time use financial intermediaries that provide research-related products or services to most or all of their customers, and - although Registrant does not request research-related products or services from such financial intermediaries - Registrant may on occasion receive and use research provided by such intermediaries. GCM Grosvenor may receive complimentary or discounted use of third-party cash management software from banking institutions in exchange for maintaining cash deposits or cash-equivalent investments (e.g., money market accounts) with such institutions, resulting in a potential conflict of interest when determining where to make such deposits or investments.    Item 9 - Master and feeder funds with different general partners will report AUM at the feeder fund level and will individually count each fund in the structure in sections 9.A and 9.B respectively.    Item 9.B.2 - RAUM data and information set forth in responses for Registrant’s Funds investing in private equity, infrastructure, and real estate are based, in part, on the most recent value of investments reported by the managers of such investments, adjusted for cash flows, where applicable. Co-investment data is based on the 9/30/24 fair value, which is the most recent fair value available to the Registrant, adjusted for cash flows, where applicable. Foreign-denominated funds are converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of 12/31/24. Schedule D Section 7.B.1.26 - the Registrant has engaged third party service providers to support the fund accounting and administration functions of the Registrant for certain of the Registrant’s private investment funds.   Schedule D Section 7.B. - Given the publicly available nature of the Form ADV, it is our reasonable belief that the Adviser and its clients would suffer substantial, irreparable business and reputational harm, upon a disclosure of the sub-advisers to Belmont Harbor Master Fund, L.P. that are unaffiliated with the Adviser, due to the highly sensitive confidential trade secrets and intellectual property associated with that commercial information. Accordingly, we have omitted this information and will make it available to the SEC upon request."

The aggregate amount of regulatory assets under management reported in Item 5.D.3. includes regulatory assets under management attributable to a pooled investment vehicle that is a non-client proprietary account. Regulatory assets under management are reported as of December 31, 2024. See also note above. Item 5.F.  Our response to this item is in respect of applicable services registrant provides as of the date hereof.  To avoid double counting, feeder fund vehicles have been consolidated with the related master fund, and only one account per master-feeder structure where reported as a master-feeder arrangement for 7(B)(1) is counted.  Series constituting separate “private funds” for purposes of Form ADV are not counted as separate accounts for this item.  The amount of regulatory assets under management and the corresponding accounts are reported as of December 31, 2024.   Assets of any client the investors of which are solely other clients are not double counted in regulatory assets under management, but such client is counted as an account.  Where such client is a non-United States person, only the assets of its investors who are non-United States persons will be counted for 5(F)(3).  Item 7.A.  Certain related persons of the registrant exercise control or investment discretion over family investment vehicles for which they receive no compensation. These vehicles are not listed on Item 7A of Schedule D.  Item 7.B.  The registrant has created, and from time to time may create, special purpose vehicles that are or may be utilized by its advisory clients, third party co-investors and a non-client proprietary account to implement portions of their investment strategies.  These are generally not listed as private funds.  The financial statements and investor account statements sent to investors in the registrant’s private funds that hold an interest in any SPV reflect all applicable information related to such SPVs, including such SPVs that are listed as private funds.   Similarly, this ADV reflects certain SPV information, such as custodians, as applicable to the registrant’s private funds. The registrant lists private fund clients it advises as of the date hereof.  For such funds, current gross asset value is regulatory assets under management for such fund or applicable master-feeder structure as of December 31, 2024, except for Monarch VI Select Opportunities Luxembourg SCSp, MVISO Offshore Holdings LP, Monarch VI Select Opportunities LP, and Monarch VI Select Opportunities Aggregator LP, for which the measurement date is July 1, 2025.

Beneficial ownership reported in respect of Monarch Capital Master Partners II LP includes investors with rights to distributions. Custodian information is provided as of March 28, 2025, except for Monarch VI Select Opportunities Luxembourg SCSp, MVISO Offshore Holdings LP, Monarch VI Select Opportunities LP, and Monarch VI Select Opportunities Aggregator LP, for which the custodian information is as of the date hereof, in all cases based on information available at the time of preparation of the relevant filing.  Stated minimum investment amounts are subject to waiver and generally are waived under certain circumstances. The registrant may employ service providers or valuation specialists to value positions, but ultimately it is the registrant that decides the final valuation in accordance with its Valuation Policy.  Certain marketers used by certain funds may themselves use sub marketers in connection with their services to the fund.  Item 9.  Our response to this item is in respect of clients that registrant advises as of the date hereof.  To avoid double-counting, the aggregate assets attributable to a master-feeder structure reflect the assets of any underlying SPVs (e.g., the value of master fund assets invested in a special purpose vehicle are not counted twice).    Consistent with registrant’s response to Item 5F, assets of any client the investors of which are solely other clients are not double-counted for purposes of reporting assets for which the registrant has custody, however such client is counted as a client for which registrant has custody. The dollar amount of funds and securities shown is calculated in the same manner as regulatory assets under management except that uncalled capital commitments are excluded.  The dollar amount of funds and securities is for current clients, valued as of December 31, 2024.   As between the registrant and its related persons that act as general partner to certain of the registrant’s clients (each, a “GP”), assets (of a master-feeder structure where reporting as a master-feeder arrangement for 7(B)(1)) are attributed to the registrant except where a GP acts a general partner for the master fund of such master-feeder structure.  For attribution of client count, such master-feeder structures are not aggregated. Item 10.

2006278,"SCHEDULE B: For federal income taxes purposes Davenport & Company LLC (the “LLC”) is organized as a limited liability company that is owned by five corporations that have elected to be taxed as S Corporations.  The multiple S Corporations are required due to tax law limitations on the number of permitted shareholders per each S Corporation.  Davenport's Schedule A lists the following five S corporations as direct owners: DAVENPORT & CO. OF VIRGINIA, INC; DAVENPORT CORP;  DAVA CORP; DAVENPORT IV, INC.; AND DAVENPORT FIVE, INC.  While this structure results in 5 direct owners of the membership units of the LLC; the only beneficial owners of the LLC are the shareholders of the S Corporations, all of whom are employees of the LLC.  For voting purposes, each individual shareholder of one of the S Corporation votes his or her shares on any matters with his or her S Corporation which in turn are relayed to the LLC without alteration.  Since the number of LLC membership units exactly equals the aggregate number of outstanding S Corporation shares, each vote by an S Corporation share is also an identical vote by a membership unit in the LLC.  Accordingly, it is our view that when calculating ownership percentages, we look to the ownership percentages of the beneficial owners of the S Corporations in the aggregate.  Thus, while an individual holding shares in a single S Corporation may own 10% of that S Corporation's shares, that same individual may have only 1% of the beneficial ownership of the membership units in the LLC. No individual employee indirectly holds more than 10% of membership interest of the firm.  SCHEDULE D, SECTION 7.B: DAVENPORT HAS CERTAIN RELATED PERSONS WHO ARE ALSO GENERAL PARTNERS OF FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NOT LISTED ON SECTION 7.B OF SCHEDULE D.

PwC informed the Adviser that a member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited performed non-audit services for an entity acquired by a non-U.S.-domiciled portfolio company controlled by certain funds managed by the Adviser. Following this acquisition, from December 2022 to January 2023, such member firm provided legal services, which services are inconsistent with the auditor independence rules pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(4)(ix) of Regulation S-X. The fees incurred for these services after the entity became an affiliate of the HPS Relevant Funds were approximately $7,500.  PwC communicated the facts and circumstances surrounding these services to the Adviser, including the scope and duration of these services, the associated fees incurred by PwC and the steps taken to terminate the impermissible services. PwC also noted the identified services did not have any direct accounting impact on the financial results of the HPS Relevant Funds. The Adviser and PwC have separately considered the impact that the services may have had on PwC’s objectivity and impartiality with respect to PwC’s audit of the HPS Relevant Funds. After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, PwC concluded that (i) PwC is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection with their audits of the HPS Relevant Funds’ financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and (ii) a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.

In these instances, the firm checks all Municipal Bond quotes against the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system to ensure pricing is in line. EMMA provides recent transactions per CUSIP, so in most cases we are able to see the spread that has been priced into the bonds to insure it's appropriate.  Once selected, the firm will purchase the bond through the selected broker at the agreed upon price, and the bond will then be settled into the client's custodial account.

2005655,"The registrant shares investment staff with certain non-US affiliated entities, and the registrant has included all such personnel in its responses to Item 5.A and Item 5.B. Certain advisory clients are structured as a fund established for a single investor or a group of affiliated investors and for purposes of Form ADV Part 1A are treated (i) as a pooled investment vehicle and (ii) as a private fund only to the extent it relies on either of the exemptions provided by 3(c)1 or 3(c)7 of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.  Certain of these private fund advisory clients were established for non-U.S. third-party investors that have expressly requested that the advisory client prepare annual audited financial statements in accordance with accounting principles other than U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (e.g., International Financial Reporting Standards). Certain advisory clients have the right to opt-out of certain investment opportunities under certain circumstances. Notwithstanding any such opt-out rights, the registrant classifies such client accounts as discretionary. Related persons of the registrant who serve as general partners, commodity pool operators or managers of pooled investment vehicles or as other investment advisers that are not listed on section 7.A. of this Schedule D are listed on the Form ADV of one or more of the following affiliated investment advisers that are separately registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): (i)AlpInvest Partners B.V. (SEC File no. 801- 72890); (ii) AlpInvest Private Equity Investment Management, LLC (SEC file no. 801-126208); (iii) Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-52462); and (iv) Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-77691).  The minimum investment commitment indicated for any private fund may be reduced in the discretion of the applicable general partner or the registrant.  Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have limited partners which are themselves pooled investment vehicles established and controlled by a third-party not affiliated with the registrant.  While any such vehicle may have invested all, or substantially all, of its assets into the private fund, the registrant deems such vehicles to be a “fund-of-funds” rather than a “feeder fund” for purposes section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D hold certain investments through, or in parallel with, special purpose holding companies or alternative investment vehicles organized to address tax, regulatory or structural considerations in connection with certain transactions.   Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D make co-investments in portfolio companies alongside other private equity funds that are not managed by the registrant or one of its controlled affiliates. In most cases, the lead sponsor of the buyout transaction will structure the co-investment such that the private fund invests via a dedicated co-investment vehicle controlled by the lead sponsor. Additionally, certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D that invest in other private equity funds or venture funds will receive from time to time distributions of marketable securities from the underlying fund, which securities are later sold on the open market. For purposes of Form ADV, the registrant classifies all such private funds as a fund-of-funds regardless of the amount of their exposure to direct investments.     Certain separate account clients are structured as a “fund of one” but are not reported as a “pooled investment vehicle” for purposes of Form ADV Part 1.   For purposes of Item 5, such clients are categorized by the type that is applicable to the client’s underlying investor; however, for purposes of Item 9, such clients are subject to an annual audit by an independent public accountant and such audited financials are distributed to the investor. With respect to Item 27 of Section 7.B.(1), as a manager of private equity fund-of-funds, the registrant relies heavily on the valuations provided by the underlying private investment fund managers. The registrant conducts independent due diligence to gain comfort with the values provided and the assumptions and conditions used to generate the fair market values of the underlying private investment fund’s asset and liabilities. The registrant has the ability to make fair market value adjustments, but it has only done so very limited circumstances since inception.  Certain non-U.S. separate account clients maintain bank accounts over which the registrant shares control.  Such bank accounts have overdraft facilities if the account becomes overdrawn.  The registrant does not deem any drawings on such facilities as borrowings for purposes of item 5.K of Form ADV Part 1A.  With respect to the registrant’s regulatory assets under management and gross asset values that consist of interests in underlying private investment funds or vehicles managed by third-party investment managers, the fair market value of such interests as of December 31, 2024 is based on the latest available valuations of such interests as provided by such third-party investment managers as of September 30, 2024, plus the net cash flows (i.e., capital calls and distributions) since such date, up to and including December 31, 2024.  All non-USD based cash flows and fair market values have been converted from the actual relevant currency to USD using foreign-exchange rates as of December 31, 2024.   The registrant and Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. each provide advisory services with respect to a certain private fund (and the manager thereof) within Carlyle’s Global Investment Solutions business segment. Each of the registrant and Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. has included the approximately $72 million related to such fund within such adviser’s respective total regulatory assets under management.  In addition to registrations with foreign financial regulatory authorities disclosed in this Form ADV, the registrant has sought authorization to market certain private fund clients in various non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to applicable private placement or similar regimes. The registrant and certain of its related persons are currently relying on CFTC No-Action Letter No 12-38 relief from the registration requirement for commodity pool operators of fund-of-funds that otherwise may have to register (or rely on another exemption from registration) as a result of their indirect exposure to commodity interests.   The registrant currently does not have a chief executive officer; however, the responsibilities of this position are primarily carried out by the head of Carlyle’s Global Investment Solutions business segment."

There are a large number of these entities, and they are generally not considered to be clients of the advisor.  In addition, most of which do not serve in the GP or similar capacity for pooled investment vehicles, rather they serve as tax blockers, or other types of holding entities for the ownership of interests in real estate.  In addition, each REOC has a dedicated general partner for its structure.

The employees included in response to Item 5 of Part 1A may not be solely dedicated to clients of the Registrant but may also make investment recommendations to clients of affiliates.  Information provided in Item 5 includes regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) (1) with respect to which an investment adviser that is a related person of the Registrant has delegated investment advisory authority to the Registrant; and (2) attributable to the amount that clients of the Registrant have invested in clients advised by an investment adviser that is a related person of the Registrant. As a result, per the instructions to Form ADV, the RAUM attributable to such delegated and/or invested assets are included in the RAUM of both the Registrant and such affiliated advisers.

Section 7.B(2) of Schedule D: Blackstone ISG-II Advisors L.L.C (“BIS”) advises Blackstone Diversified Alternatives Asset Issuer L.L.C. (“Issuer LLC”).   Issuer LLC is the 100% owner of Blackstone Diversified Alternatives Asset Holdco L.L.C. (“HoldCo LLC”), which is a special purpose vehicle established solely to facilitate making Issuer LLC’s investments.  For that reason, BIS reports Issuer LLC in its Section 7.B(1) and does not separately report HoldCo LLC. While Blackstone Liquid Credit Advisors I LLC (“BLCA I”) sub-advises HoldCo LLC, BLCA I has determined that given the fact that HoldCo LLC is solely a special purpose vehicle of Issuer LLC, to identify Issuer LLC as a sub-advised fund in BLCA I’s Section 7.B(2) (rather than to identify Holdco LLC).

2002995,"The minimum investment commitment indicated for any private fund may be reduced in the discretion of the applicable general partner or the registrant.   Certain advisory clients are structured as a fund established for a single investor or a group of affiliated investors and for purposes of Form ADV Part 1A are treated (i) as a pooled investment vehicle and (ii) as a private fund to the extent it relies on either of the exemptions provided by 3(c)1 or 3(c)7 of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.  Certain private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D hold certain investments through, or in parallel with, special purpose holding companies or alternative investment vehicles organized to address tax, regulatory or structural considerations in connection with certain transactions. With respect to Item 27 of section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D, as a manager of real estate fund-of-funds, the registrant relies heavily on the valuations provided by the underlying private investment fund managers. The registrant conducts independent due diligence to gain comfort with the values provided and the assumptions and conditions used to generate the fair market values of the underlying private investment fund’s asset and liabilities. The registrant has the ability to make fair market value adjustments, but has only done so in limited circumstances since inception.   Certain private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D (the “Global Funds”) were established specifically to solely invest in two or more other private funds of the registrant. Because the Global Funds do not invest in a single master fund, they are not identified as feeder funds for purposes of section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D. Further, the allocable portion of gross asset amounts provided for each such private fund also will be reflected in the gross asset amount for the relevant other private funds of the registrant in which they invest. Additionally, for purposes of reporting the ownership information for the underlying private funds of the registrant in which such Global Funds hold an interest, the registrant has looked through such Global Funds to their respective limited partners as if they invested directly in the private funds of the registrant.   Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have limited partners which are themselves pooled investment vehicles established and controlled by a third party not affiliated with the registrant.  While any such vehicle may have invested all, or substantially all, of its assets into the private fund, the registrant deems such vehicles to be “funds-of-funds” rather than a “feeder fund” for purposes section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D.  With respect to the registrant’s regulatory assets under management and gross asset values that consist of interests in underlying private investment funds or vehicles managed by third-party investment managers, the fair market value of such interests as of December 31, 2021 is based on the latest available valuations of such interests as provided by such third-party investment managers as of September 30, 2021, plus the net cash flows (i.e., capital calls and distributions) since such date, up to and including December 31, 2021. All non-USD based cash flows and fair market values have been converted from the actual relevant currency to USD using fx rates as of December 31, 2021.   None of the registrant’s private funds or other advisory clients currently trade commodity interests. Nevertheless, the registrant and certain of its related persons are currently relying on CFTC No-Action Letter No 12-38 relief from the registration requirement for commodity pool operators of fund-of-funds that otherwise may have to register (or rely on another exemption from registration) as a result of their indirect exposure to commodity interests. Accordingly, the registrant has responded in the affirmative to the questions in Item 6.A that it is actively engaged as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading adviser (even though the registrant does not believe this to be the case).   In addition to registrations with foreign financial regulatory authorities (if any) disclosed in this Form ADV, the registrant has sought authorization to market certain private fund clients in various non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to applicable private placement or similar regimes."

A SLOA authorizes the advisor to disburse funds according to specific designated requests. For instance, a client may request that funds be disbursed monthly to a care facility for an elderly parent, to a child’s school for tuition, or for other recurring needs. In order to protect investor interests and guard against misappropriation of funds, the “Custody Rule” requires that seven conditions be met:   1.The client provides an instruction to the qualified custodian, in writing, that includes the client’s signature, the third party’s name, and either the third party’s address or the third party’s account number at a custodian to which the transfer should be directed.  2.The client authorizes the investment adviser, in writing, either on the qualified custodian’s form or separately, to direct transfers to the third party either on a specified schedule or from time to time.  3.The client’s qualified custodian performs appropriate verification of the instruction, such as a signature review or other method to verify the client’s authorization, and provides a transfer of funds notice to the client promptly after each transfer.  4.The client has the ability to terminate or change the instruction to the client’s qualified custodian.  5.The investment adviser has no authority or ability to designate or change the identity of the third party, the address, or any other information about the third party contained in the client’s instruction.  6.The investment adviser maintains records showing that the third party is not a related party of the investment adviser or located at the same address as the investment adviser.  7.The client’s qualified custodian sends the client, in writing, an initial notice confirming the instruction and an annual notice reconfirming the instruction.

McHugh is both the investment advisor as well as the client, by virtue of the fact that he is the trustee named in a trust agreement.

Circumstances in which Terrence P. McHugh is named as trustee primarily occur when Terrence P. McHugh has been named as trustee by the grantors of trusts, because of his legal and financial experience.  In those cases, the assets are held at Fidelity Investments, and Terrence P. McHugh also acts as the investment advisor to the trustee, with the full knowledge and consent of the grantor of the trust.     In cases where Terrence P. McHugh acts as a trustee, and as investment advisor to the trustee, The McHugh Group has determined such an arrangement means that the investment advisor has “custody” of those assets.   In all such instances the assets are held by Fidelity Investments, which serves as a qualified custodian and Fidelity Investments provides monthly account statements detailing all account assets and activities."

Category (g), “Pension and profit sharing plans (but not the plan participants or government pension plans), individual clients that were previously included in this category are now included individual categories.  Section 5.K.(1) Asset Categories Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC. used the following methodology to determine how to categorize assets that could be classified in more than one category: 1.            Common stock, preferred securities, structured products and units are included in the Exchange-Traded Equity Securities category if the security traded on a national exchange and within the Non Exchange-Traded Equity Securities category if they do not traded on a national exchange.  2.            Investment Grade Corporate Bonds include corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of BBB or higher and a Moody’s rating of Baa or higher. Corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of below BBB or a Moody’s rating below Baa are categorized as Non-Investment Grade Corporate Bonds.  Those securities given opposing ratings by Moody’s and S&P (investment-grade and non-investment grade) automatically default to the non-investment grade category.  3.            Annuities have characteristics that are not primarily representative of any of the defined asset categories, therefore annuity products are listed in the Other category.   4.            Derivative regulatory asset values are calculated using the absolute market value of the security.  Section 5. F (2) Information about you Advisory Business - Regulatory Assets Under Management:  This year’s calculations for Regulatory Assets Under Management will include accounts for which Janney has a Consulting Service arrangement in place. These accounts are kept in custody outside of Janney and the  Janney Financial Advisor renders advice on these accounts. There are a total of 17 accounts and $170,191,388.21 in Assets Under Management.   Section 5.K. (2) Gross Notional Exposure Historical delta was unavailable to compute delta adjusted notional value. Option notional values were calculated without being adjusted for delta.  2017 RAUM was duplicated by the number of assets in each account causing RAUM to be overstated and some accounts to be represented in the wrong exposure level.

In order to protect investor interests and guard against misappropriation of funds, the “Custody Rule” requires that seven conditions be met:   1.The client provides an instruction to the qualified custodian, in writing, that includes the client’s signature, the third party’s name, and either the third party’s address or the third party’s account number at a custodian to which the transfer should be directed.  2.The client authorizes the investment adviser, in writing, either on the qualified custodian’s form or separately, to direct transfers to the third party either on a specified schedule or from time to time.  3.The client’s qualified custodian performs appropriate verification of the instruction, such as a signature review or other method to verify the client’s authorization, and provides a transfer of funds notice to the client promptly after each transfer.  4.The client has the ability to terminate or change the instruction to the client’s qualified custodian.  5.The investment adviser has no authority or ability to designate or change the identity of the third party, the address, or any other information about the third party contained in the client’s instruction.  6.The investment adviser maintains records showing that the third party is not a related party of the investment adviser or located at the same address as the investment adviser.  7.The client’s qualified custodian sends the client, in writing, an initial notice confirming the instruction and an annual notice reconfirming the instruction.  If these conditions are not met, an advisor may be subject to a surprise examination of client assets by an independent public accountant. At Cardiff Park Advisors, the assets reported in Item 9.A are held at Schwab and Fidelity and are maintained according to terms of the Custody Rule, thereby meeting these seven conditions."

2003742,"For Schedule D, Section 1.F, Global Infrastructure Management, LLC and its affiliates (“GIM”) maintain a liaison office in Seoul, Korea, and certain private funds maintain a Luxembourg office for regulatory local presence requirements. GIM can provide additional information regarding these locations upon request.  For Item 5, regulatory assets under management reflect the gross aggregate value of the assets held by private funds and separately managed accounts as of year-end plus unfunded capital commitments. GIM forms special purpose vehicles to serve as the general partners or managing members of certain private funds managed by GIM and are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC letter addressed to the American Bar Association’s Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities dated October 8, 2005, as updated on January 18, 2012. From time to time, certain private funds and separately managed accounts make investments through alternative investment vehicles and holding companies (collectively “AIVs”) that GIM forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory, or other structuring reasons. The AIVs have not been separately reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), but information regarding the AIVs has been aggregated with the private funds or separately managed accounts to which they relate. Regulatory assets under management and gross asset values are estimated and unaudited and may differ materially from the final audited amounts. Certain entities recently formed or being wound down with gross asset values of zero or near zero as of year-end are not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1). However, committed capital that has not been called by certain such recently formed entities is included in the amount of regulatory assets under management in Item 5 and the information provided in Item 9. In addition, these entities are included the number of clients managed by GIM. Where applicable, regulatory assets under management and gross asset values have been converted from EURO, INR, GBP, and AUD to USD based on the 12/31/2024 Spot Rate.   In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), the total commitment amount for each private fund was used to calculate the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), a private fund’s general partner (or similar managing entity) is not counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13, and the general partner’s commitment amount is excluded when calculating the percentages for the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), where applicable, investors in a private fund who have made capital commitments but have not yet had capital called are counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), due to the structural overlap of certain private funds, separately managed accounts, and co-investment clients, GIM answered in the negative for Question 19 and indicated zero percent for Question 20 as it believes that such structural overlap does not constitute a solicitation of any such client or investment by any such client into a private fund. For purposes of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), in response to Question 28, GIM indicated “Yes” for private funds that are currently in an active fundraising period utilizing a third-party placement agent, and “No” for private funds that previously employed a third-party placement agent but whose fundraising period has ended. Global Infrastructure Partners Singapore Manager Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIM, is not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.A. This entity is a sub-manager to certain non-US private funds and separately managed accounts and receives management fees from such entities, but does not conduct any investment advisory services. GIP IV Cavalry Co-Invest II, L.P. is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). This entity is an investment-specific vehicle whose sole beneficial owner is Infra Investors II Co-Invest, L.P., a private fund listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). Global Infrastructure Partners IV-C / C2 AIV, L.P. was formed for investment structuring purposes and is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). However, its beneficial owners are investors in other Global Infrastructure Partners IV private funds, which are listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). For purposes of Item 8.A.(1), from time to time, GIM warehouses investments for certain private funds that have not been formed or have not closed when the investments are made. Once formed, GIM transfers the investments to the respective private funds pursuant to their governing documents. GIM discloses these warehousing arrangements and the corresponding risks to prospective investors within the relevant private placement memoranda. For purposes of Item 8.A.(2), certain of GIM’s principals and employees invest in the same investments as the private funds (including co-investments) through such funds’ general partner entities or dedicated “friends and family” vehicles. Certain private funds and separately managed accounts hold public securities indirectly at Caixa Bank.  For Schedule D, Section 7.A., GIM treats all BLK affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers and exempt reporting advisers as related persons. These advisers manage private funds and separately managed accounts not listed under Item 5.D. or Schedule D, Section 7.B.1. of GIM’s Form ADV. These private funds and separately managed accounts are reported on the respective Form ADVs of each related SEC- registered adviser and exempt reporting adviser. Similarly, Schedule D, Section 7.A. of this Form ADV excludes the general partners (and similar entities) of pooled investment vehicles or SMAs advised by GIM’s related investment advisers.

The books and records can be accessed from the GIM offices.

(Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., together with its “advisory affiliates” and “related persons” (as defined in Form ADV), the “Oaktree Entities”), which together with certain related transactions has resulted in affiliates of Brookfield owning an approximate 61.2% economic interest in Oaktree’s business (the “Acquisition”). It is expected that both Brookfield and the Oaktree Entities will continue to operate their respective investment businesses largely independently, with each remaining under its current brand and led by its existing management and investment teams, and the Oaktree Entities and Brookfield will manage their investment operations independently of each other pursuant to an information barrier.  Brookfield does not consider the Oaktree Entities to be its “advisory affiliates” or “related persons” for purposes of this Form ADV.

2002271,"At this time, General Atlantic Service Company, L.P. (“GASC”) is filing an other-than-annual amendment to reflect the delivery of audited financial statements to investors in its private funds and remove certain entities that are not private fund clients. Capitalized terms shall have the meaning set forth in GASC’s Brochure and/or the Actis Managers’ Brochure. (1) The information presented in this Part 1 is as of March 1, 2025, except for the following responses, which are as of December 31, 2024: Item 5.C(1), 5.C(2), 5.D(1) and 5.D(3); Item 5.F(2)(a)/(d) and (c)/(f); Item 5.F(3); Item 5.K(2); Item 9.B(2)(a)/(b); Item 9.F; Schedule D, Section 7.B(1). With respect to Madison Park Investments, LLC (“MPI”) and Steamboat Park Investments, LLC (“SPI), the response for Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 11 reflects the gross asset value of MPI and SPI as of September 30, 2024. (2) The Core Program Partnerships (as described in GASC’s Brochure) are included on Schedule D, Section 7.B(1) as private funds to provide information about GA’s Core Program as a whole; however, they are not traditional private fund clients as investors (i.e., Core Program Limited Partners) do not subscribe directly to them and there is no offering memorandum for any individual Core Program Partnership, only for the Core Program as a whole. Core Program Partnerships are used to aggregate capital from Core Program Limited Partners to facilitate investments in Core Program portfolio companies. However, over the life of a commitment, a Core Program Limited Partner will participate in investments through multiple Core Program Partnerships. Consequently, no single Core Program Partnership is invested in every portfolio investment in the Core Program and an individual Core Program Limited Partner will not participate in all investments made by a given Core Program Partnership. As a result, the private fund-level metrics provided in Schedule D, Section 7.B(1) of Core Program Partnerships do not reflect the actual gross asset value of any single Core Program Limited Partner. The Core Program Limited Partners receive individualized statements and reports that reflect the performance of their investment portfolio, as spread out over multiple Core Program Partnerships, because GASC believes that statements and reports for the Core Program Partnerships as a whole would not be meaningful or relevant to them. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of clients and respective amount of RAUM disclosed in Item 5.D (including in Item 5.D(1)/(3)(f) – pooled investment vehicles) represents the number of Core Program Limited Partners (i.e., “clients”) who have entered into Commitment Agreements with GASC and GA LP, as well as GASC’s other private fund clients and the Actis Managers’ private fund clients. Whereas, the number of accounts disclosed in Item 5.F(2) reflect the number of Core Program Partnerships and other private funds managed by GASC, as well as the Actis Managers’ private fund clients. GASC will provide a list of the Core Program Partnerships upon request. (4) Item 5.K. While certain Core Program Limited Partners enter into separate Commitment Agreements, GA LP and GASC do not provide individualized investment advice for each separate Core Program Limited Partner (and the Core Program Limited Partners only invest in the Core Program Partnerships on a go-forward basis). However, because Core Program Limited Partners are counted as a separate ""client"" for the purpose of the Form ADV, the Registrant has reported values in Items 5.D(1)(a) / (c) and (g) / (n) and Item 5.D(3)(a) / (c) and (g) / (n). As a result, the Registrant completed the questions in Item 5.K, even though it does not believe it manages separately managed accounts. See also note on Item 5.K(4) below. (5) Certain of the entities identified in Schedule D, Section 7.A are general partners of the Registrant’s private funds and Core Program Partnerships and are related persons of the Registrant. In reliance on the position expressed in the SEC staff’s No-Action Letter to the American Bar Association, Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities, dated December 8, 2005 (the “ABA No-Action Letter”), each such related person is deemed to rely on and be covered by the Registrant’s registration. (6) With respect to the questions regarding GASC’s related persons in Schedule D, Section 7.A, no portfolio companies of GASC’s Clients have been included in Schedule D, Section 7.A, although such portfolio companies currently include broker-dealers, other investment advisers and insurance companies, because such portfolio companies are operated by management teams that are independent of GASC. In certain cases, Supervised Persons of GASC sit on the board or committees of these portfolio companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GASC believes that such portfolio companies are not material to GASC’s advisory business or its Clients (other than their being portfolio companies) and do not create a material conflict of interest with GASC or its clients. GASC will provide a list of such portfolio companies upon request. With respect to the questions regarding the related persons of the Actis Managers in Schedule D, Section 7.A, the responses in Questions 11 and 12 have not been updated to reflect whether the Registrant and the related persons of the Actis Managers share any supervised persons or the same physical location and therefore, reflect the relationship between the Actis Managers and the respective related persons as of prior to consummation of the transaction noted above. The information in Schedule D, Section 7.A will be updated in the Registrant’s next annual amendment. (7) Schedule A: GASC is 100% owned directly and indirectly by General Atlantic Partners, LP (“GA Partners”). GASC GP LLC (“GASC GP”) is the general partner of GASC, which is wholly owned and controlled by GASC MGP, LLC (“GASC MGP”). GA GenPar Holdco (Bermuda), L.P. (“GA Bermuda”) and General Atlantic Management Holdco, L.P. (“GA Management Holdco”) own over 25% of GA Partners. GA Bermuda and GA Management Holdco are ultimately controlled by GASC MGP. GASC MGP is controlled by the Partnership Committee (formerly called the Management Committee). The Partnership Committee (i) oversees, manages and controls the affairs and business of GASC and (ii) primarily determines the strategic policy decisions of GASC MGP. Schedule A lists GASC GP, GA Partners, the Partnership and Executive Committee as of October 1, 2024, and executive officers of General Atlantic. Schedule B lists the entities that own and control GA Partners and the members of the Partnership Committee, which control GASC MGP. (9) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 12. The minimum commitment amount reported for certain private funds is the minimum amount that is or was generally accepted from investors, provided, however, that GASC has the authority to accept commitments of lessor amounts. (10) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 13. For any funds that were formed to allow GA employees to invest alongside the investment vehicles being offered to third party clients, beneficial owners were generally counted in accordance with the exclusion for investment companies under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Company Act”), even if the private fund is excluded from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(7) of the Company Act. Meaning, investors who were knowledgeable employees or qualified purchasers at the time they invested were not counted as beneficial owners of that private fund. (11) In Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 15(b), the Registrant answered ""no"" for certain private funds because the Registrant does not receive performance-based compensation from the investors in those private funds. (12) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 19. Certain of the private funds listed are alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) that were formed for the purpose of legal or tax structuring for a particular transaction or set of transactions. Since clients were not directly solicited to invest in those AIVs, the Registrant checked “No” to this question. Further, since GASC does not solicit investors to participate in AIVs/SPVs, the minimum commitment amount was listed as $0. (13) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 25. The securities held with certain of the custodians listed for certain of the Core Program Partnerships may be held in the name of an affiliated special purpose vehicle instead of in the name of the private fund listed. As a result, it is impracticable for the Registrant to attribute RAUM to specific custodians by client for the purpose of Item 5.K(4).  (14) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 28. Reflects all placement agents currently retained by the private fund during the fundraising period, even if no capital was raised by the placement agent."
2001649,"The Firm has reviewed the instructions to schedule B and note that there are no indirect owners to report."
2004356,"In Schedule A, Mauricio Sanchez, a partner that was recently terminated, does not have a middle name and/or middle initial to report.

Paul Martin is the managing partner and there are three other partners, one of whom, V. Sreenath Reddy, is an investment partner only and does not work with clients.

THE MANAGERS AND GENERAL PARTNERS OF THESE SINGLE-FAMILY VEHICLES ARE TYPICALLY HIGH NET WORTH MEMBERS OF A PARTICULAR FAMILY WHO ARE ALSO CLIENTS OF THE REGISTRANT AND ITS LAW FIRM AFFILIATE. PRIOR TO THIS 2020 ANNUAL AMENDMENT, EACH ENTITY AND INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS ISSUED AN INVOICE FOR THE REGISTRANT’S ADVISORY SERVICES WAS COUNTED AS A DISTINCT “CLIENT” OR “BENEFICIAL OWNER” FOR PURPOSES OF THIS FORM. “CLIENTS” AND “BENEFICIAL OWNERS” ARE COUNTED BASED ON FAMILIAL AFFILIATION.  FOR CLARITY, THIS MEANS THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES THAT ARE RELATED PERSONS OF A PARTICULAR FAMILY ARE TREATED AS ONE CLIENT.  THE GROUPING OF CLIENTS IN THIS MANNER BETTER REFLECTS HOW THE REGISTRANT ENGAGES AND CONTRACTS WITH ITS ULTIMATE CLIENTS AND WILL RESULT IN CLIENT AND BENEFICIAL OWNER COUNTS ON THIS FORM THAT APPEAR TO BE LOWER THAN IN PREVIOUS FILINGS.

With respect to question 1.F, the principal office and place of business of the Filing Adviser is located at the Filing Adviser’s U.S. address located at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022. The Filing Adviser has two investment management and administrative offices that direct the business of the Filing Adviser which are located in New York and London. Additionally, there are two branch offices: one is located in Florida and was established in June 2018 and the second is located in Boston and was established in January 2025.

All personnel acting on behalf of a Relying Adviser in connection with the performance of investment advisory services are individuals who are considered by the Filing Adviser to be persons associated with the Filing Adviser and whose activities are subject to the supervision and control of the Filing Adviser. As long as the Filing Adviser is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, each Relying Adviser will conduct its investment advisory activities as if it were itself so registered. In addition, the Filing Adviser has an affiliated registered investment adviser, Tetragon Financial Management LP (""TFM""), which has related persons that are not listed in Section 7.A of Schedule D. Information about Tetragon is available in the Form ADV of TFM. Tetragon, a client of TFM, may invest in private funds managed by certain of the Relying Advisers and Affiliated Adviser.

Clients that act as ""feeder funds"" are disregarded for purposes of answering questions 14, 19 and 20 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D. With respect to LCM Asset Management LLC, LCM EURO LLC, and LCM EURO II LLC (together ""LCM"") and TCI CM, each Relying Advisers, due to the nature of the collateralized loan obligations (""CLOs"") (identified as securitized asset funds) that LCM and TCI CM manage as listed in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, the Filing Adviser, LCM, and TCI CM generally cannot access information regarding the beneficial ownership of the securities of the CLOs. Accordingly, we are unable to provide the information requested in questions 13, 15 and 16 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D. With respect to question 14 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, Tetragon, Tetragon Credit Income II L.P., Tetragon Credit Income III L.P., Tetragon Credit Income IV L.P., and Tetragon Credit Income V L.P. may invest in certain CLOs that LCM and TCI CM manage and such amounts have been included in the relevant calculations. Moreover, with respect to such CLOs, the service providers listed as ""administrators"" and ""custodians"" in questions 25 and 26 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are trustees of such CLOs. Additionally, with respect to question 28 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, CLOs typically pay placement fees in connection with their establishment. The assets under management and custody figures reported in Item 5 and Item 9, respectively are as of December 31, 2024 except for Tetragon Credit Income V L.P.

With respect to question 11 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, gross asset figures reported are as of December 31, 2024 except for (i) Tetragon Credit Income V L.P. (and associated feeder funds) where figures are reported as of its first close which occurred on February 21, 2025. In addition, the RAUM and AUM figures for Contingency Capital Fund II Finance Master LP and Contingency Capital Fund II Investment Master LP, (together ""CC Fund II"") include the RAUM and AUM of Tuntsa LP which as of December 31, 2024 invests all of its assets in CC Fund II.  With respect to Tetragon Credit Income III L.P. (“TCI III”), the assets of the fund are held in Tetragon Credit Income III LLC, risk retention series, a wholly owned subsidiary of TCI III, however, such amounts have been reflected in question 11 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D for TCI III. Furthermore, with respect to Tetragon Credit Income IV L.P. (""TCI IV”), the assets of the fund are held in the investment series of TCI IV LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of TCI IV and in the retention series of each of Flatiron RR LLC and Elmwood RR CLO LLC, in which TCI IV is a member and controls the activities of the respective Retention Series of such entities.

Please note – With respect to answering Item 5.F.(2)(b), the amount of Non-Discretionary Regulatory Assets Under Management (""Non-Discretionary RAUM"")  is 0, however, in order to submit this Annual Amendment as indicated by the IARD system, we had to enter an amount of Non-Discretionary RAUM that exceeded our number of non-discretionary accounts. Since we have 6 non-discretionary accounts/clients, we entered an amount of $7.00 in response to this question in order for the IARD system to allow us to submit the filing. The correct amount of RAUM for our 6 non-discretionary clients is 0. Furthermore, we also had to enter $7.00 in response to Item 5.D.(3)(n) although the correct amount is 0 in order for the total RAUM figure provided in Item 5.F.(2)(c) to match the sum of RAUM amounts provided for Item 5.D.(3)."

2000055,"As described in the Part 2A of the Registrant’s Form ADV, the Registrant currently provides advice with respect to infrastructure assets to: (i) AC in relation to AC’s administration of the OMERS primary pension plan and (ii) third party co-investors in certain Co-Investment Programs. The foregoing is for informational purposes and is also in response to Item 5.G.(12). As of December 31, 2024, the net assets of the OMERS primary pension plan was approximately CAD$138 billion or USD$96 billion, all of which were administered by AC. An amount of those assets, as determined by the OMERS Board, is allocated for potential infrastructure investments. Item 1.F: From time to time, the associated persons of OMERS Infrastructure may conduct their US advisory activities from affiliated offices in the United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Amsterdam and Australia. Items 5.A. and B.: We have included associated persons of the Registrant employed by related persons of the Registrant. Item 5.F.: In determining our regulatory assets under management, we do not deduct any outstanding indebtedness or other accrued but unpaid liabilities of pooled investment vehicles or pension and profit sharing plans, but note that for purposes of this filing, indebtedness and/or other accrued but unpaid liabilities have been deducted in calculating the equity value of portfolio companies held by such clients. Items 5.D.(3)(f) and (g), 9.A.(2)(a) and 9.B.(2)(a): In calculating the dollar value of its assets under management for purposes of Items 5.D.(3)(f) and (g), and 9.A.(2)(a). and 9.B.(2)(a), the Registrant has included only amounts invested in infrastructure assets advised by the Registrant, and has not included any uninvested capital from the OMERS primary pension plan or Co-Investors. To avoid the double counting of assets, for purposes of that calculation, the Registrant has excluded from the calculation of the assets attributable to pension and profit sharing plans referenced in Item 5.D.(3)(g), the assets of the OMERS primary pension plan that have been invested in the pooled investment vehicle referenced in Item 5.D.(3)(f).  In addition, for purposes of identifying the types of clients advised by the Registrant in Item 5.D.(1), the Registrant has deemed those vehicles that hold only assets of the OMERS primary pension plan to be pension and profit sharing plans, and those vehicles that hold assets invested by the OMERS primary pension plan and Co-Investors as pooled investment vehicles.

In addition, for purposes of identifying the types of clients advised by the Registrant in Item 5.D.(1), the Registrant has deemed those vehicles that hold only assets of the OMERS primary pension plan to be pension and profit sharing plans, and those vehicles that hold assets invested by the OMERS primary pension plan and Co-Investors as pooled investment vehicles.

As a result, per the instructions to Form ADV, the RAUM attributable to such delegated and/or invested assets are included in the RAUM of both the Registrant and such affiliated advisers.  Additionally, information provided in Item 5 excludes RAUM attributable to an investment by one client in another client that would represent a duplication of assets already included in calculating RAUM (so that such assets are counted only once); however, to the extent either or both of the relevant clients is a private fund, the gross asset value reported in Question 11 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D for each such private fund includes any such assets attributable to the amount invested in or by the other client.  Please note that Blackstone Loan Financing Limited (“BGLF”) is a publicly-traded, London Stock Exchange-listed fund. However, BGLF interests may be offered to certain U.S. investors on a private placement basis. Accordingly, we have included BGLF as a private fund for purposes of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. We have specified that the minimum investment amount is $0, since there is no minimum investment amount. The Registrant and its affiliates have little to no visibility on the underlying investors in the collateralized loan vehicles (""CLOs"") it manages or in BGLF. Thus, we are unable to provide certain information on the composition of the investors (e.g., number of beneficial owners, number of fund of funds investors, number of non-U.S. investors, etc.) and have included ""0"" (zero) in our response to those questions.
