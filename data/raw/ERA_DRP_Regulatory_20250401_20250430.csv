IT THEREFORE DECIDED TO TERMINATE THE DEALER AGREEMENT IT HAD WITH THE IDENTIFIED DEALERS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THOSE AGREEMENTS. CONCURRENT WITH THOSE TERMINATIONS, AMCA REQUIRED THE CLIENTS OF THE IDENTIFIED DEALERS TO REDEEM THEIR FUND UNITS (THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS). THE BCSC AND AMCA SETTLED ON THE BASIS THAT THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS DEPRIVED THE IMPACTED UNITHOLDERS OF THE OPTION TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THE SECURITY THAT THEY PURCHASED. THIS WAS UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO PURCHASED THE FUNDS RELYING ON DISCLOSURE THAT THEY WERE SUITABLE FOR INVESTORS WITH LONG TERM TIME HORIZON. THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS MAY HAVE CAUSED FINANCIAL HARM TO CERTAIN IMPACTED UNITHOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIVITY, AMCA FAILED TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH THE UNITHOLDERS AND THEREFORE CONTRAVENED SECTION 14 OF THE SECURITIES RULES (BRITISH COLUMBIA). OTHER FACTORS RELEVANT TO THE SETTLEMENT ARE THAT AMCA DID NOT PROFIT OR RECEIVE AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE FROM THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS.

THE TRADERS ON THE IRD DESK AND FAST DESK SEPARATELY ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT BY MISMARKING THEIR POSITIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EITHER INFLATING PROFITS AND MINIMIZING LOSSES, OR TO ""SMOOTH"" OUT RETURNS, RESPECTIVELY. THE ORDER REQUIRES NATIXIS TO PAY A $2.8 MILLION CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, CEASE AND DESIST FROM VIOLATING APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT (CEA) AND CFTC REGULATIONS, AND COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS.  CASE BACKGROUND BETWEEN JANUARY 2015 AND AT LEAST APRIL 2018, A TRADER ON THE BANK'S IRD DESK SUBMITTED FALSE OR MISLEADING ENTRIES IN THE BANK'S INTERNAL RECORDKEEPING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM RELATING TO THE MARKING OF THE END-OF-DAY USD LIBOR FORWARD CURVE (CLOSING CURVE), FOR THE PURPOSE OF INFLATING THE UNREALIZED PROFIT AND LOSS (P&L) OF THE DESK HE MANAGED AND DISGUISING SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES. SPECIFICALLY, THE TRADER ENGAGED IN A PATTERN OF MARKING THE CLOSING CURVE IN A MANNER THAT VARIED FROM OBSERVED BROKER MID PRICES AND IN A MANNER THAT ALIGNED WITH THE RISK POSITIONS OF THE IRD DESK, WHILE GENERALLY STAYING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS DESIGNED TO DETECT MISMARKING. ALTHOUGH NATIXIS MAINTAINED CERTAIN CONTROLS RELATING TO THE MARKING OF THE CLOSING CURVE, THOSE CONTROLS WERE INSUFFICIENT TO DETECT THE TRADER'S MISCONDUCT FOR OVER THREE YEARS. AT ITS PEAK IN EARLY 2018, THE TRADER'S MISMARKING OF THE CLOSING CURVE OVERSTATED THE P&L OF THE IRD DESK BY APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE ORDER FURTHER FINDS THAT NATIXIS FAILED TO DILIGENTLY SUPERVISE THE ACTIVITIES OF ITS FAST DESK. SPECIFICALLY, BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2017 AND NOVEMBER 2019, TRADERS ON THE FAST DESK MADE CERTAIN MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BANK'S INTERNAL TRADE BOOKING SYSTEMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ""SMOOTHING"" OR HIDING THE FAST DESK'S P&L AND LATER RELEASING THE P&L DURING DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS.  AT ITS PEAK, THE P&L SMOOTHING UNDERSTATED THE UNREALIZED P&L OF THE FAST DESK BY OVER $6 MILLION. THIS MISCONDUCT RENDERED THE BANK'S BOOKS AND RECORDS INACCURATE.  IN ACCEPTING THE BANK'S OFFER OF SETTLEMENT, THE CFTC RECOGNIZED ITS SUBSTANTIAL COOPERATION DURING THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT'S INVESTIGATION OF THIS MATTER. THE CFTC NOTED THAT THE BANK'S SUBSTANTIAL COOPERATION AND REMEDIATION ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FORM OF A REDUCED CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY.","Final","N/A","Settled","09/06/2022","Y","","Y","2800000","N","N","N","N","N","N","N/A","N/A","SEE RESPONSE TO QUESTION 7.

THE MATTER RELATED TO THE MANNER IN WHICH DBAG VALUED ""GAP RISK"" ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN LEVERAGED SUPER SENIOR (LSS) SYNTHETIC CDO POSITIONS DURING Q4 2008 AND Q1 2009, WHICH WAS THE HEIGHT OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. GAP RISK IS THE RISK OF LOSS THAT CAN RESULT IF THE PRESENT VALUE OF A TRADE FALLS BELOW THE VALUE OF COLLATERAL FOR THE TRADE POSTED BY THE COUNTERPARTY. DURING THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE, DBAG DID NOT ADJUST ITS VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES TO ACCOUNT FOR GAP RISK, ESSENTIALLY ASSIGNING A ZERO VALUE FOR GAP RISK. THE SEC FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO STANDARD INDUSTRY MODEL TO VALUE GAP RISK AND THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS WAS COMPLEX, DBAG DID NOT REASONABLY ADJUST THE VALUE OF THE LSS TRADES FOR GAP RISK DURING THESE PERIODS, RESULTING IN MISSTATEMENTS OF ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE TWO QUARTERS AT ISSUE. THE SEC ALSO FOUND THAT DBAG FAILED TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE SYSTEMS AND CONTROLS OVER THE VALUATION PROCESS. THE SEC FOUND VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 13(A) (REQUIREMENT TO FILE ACCURATE PERIODIC REPORTS WITH THE SEC), 13(B)(2)(A) (REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE BOOKS AND RECORDS), AND 13(B)(2)(B)(REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS).
