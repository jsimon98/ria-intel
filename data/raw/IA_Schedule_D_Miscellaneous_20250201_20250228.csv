The address reported in Section 1.L. of Schedule D is the corporate address for Microsoft O365 as Microsoft O365 does not disclose the address of its cloud storage facilities for security reasons. The asset amounts reported in Items 5 and 9 and Section 7.B of Schedule D are as of November 1, 2024. For one or more certain private fund clients of Moontower, Moontower has determined that it has discretionary authority over such fund’s assets, notwithstanding that the investor in that fund is entitled to an “opt-out” right that allows such investor to elect not to participate in an investment made by the fund. Entities controlled by a third-party investor in Mt Carmel Bixby N LLC and Mt Carmel Bixby PI LLC, which are reported as private funds in Schedule D Section 7.B, have made an initial capital commitment to these two private funds on a combined basis. For purposes of reporting asset amounts for such funds in Section 7.B, the commitment has been allocated 50-50 between the two funds. In addition, these two funds have certain board of director members who are affiliated with a third-party investor that is invested in such private funds and who are not affiliated with Moontower. Those board of director members are not listed in response to Question 3.(a) of Section 7.B for such funds. The general partners of Moontower-advised private funds are ultimately principally owned by Russell James Valdez and Connor Ramsay Stewart, who are listed on Schedule A, and/or entities affiliated therewith. In addition, certain other Moontower personnel and/or individuals with whom the firm has a relationship are expected to have non-controlling interests in general partner entities, including for purposes of receiving a portion of the carried interest (or similar compensation) to which such entities may be entitled. Certain funds may make investments through alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) or special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) that are formed to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory or other structuring reasons. Any such AIVs and SPVs have not been separately listed in Schedule D Section 7.B, but any assets they may hold are included in the asset values reported in Section 7.B for the reported private funds to which they relate. For private fund clients with respect to which Moontower has indicated in Section 7.B that their financial statements are subject to annual audit, the audit firm reported therein has been engaged to conduct an audit of the fund’s financial statements covering the period from the date the fund first had cash or investment activity until on or after December 31, 2024. The responses to Items 9.B(2)(b) and 9.F and Section 7.B Question 25 report information regarding the number of clients that held bank accounts with a custodian as of November 1, 2024 and regarding the custodian with which such accounts were held as of such date. Moontower kindly requests that the Commission refrain from deeming its registration effective prior to January 1, 2025."

The SEC Complaint alleges CBI is operating as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and failed to register its staking-as-a-service program as a security.

In each case, when we commence reporting of performance to investors, we will report an aggregate return to investors based on the consolidated performance of both Master Funds. We believe this approach better reflects how investors view the investment (i.e., as an investment into one fund based on one capital commitment rather than an investment into multiple funds).  GoldenTree has six affiliated, U.S.-based relying advisers, GoldenTree Loan Management, LP (""GLM Master"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM, LP (""GLM Sub"" and together with ""GLM Master"", collectively “GLM”), GoldenTree Loan Management II LP (""GLM Master II"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM II, LP (""GLM Sub II"" and together with ""GLM Master II"", collectively “GLM II”) and GoldenTree Loan Management III LP (""GLM Master III"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM III, LP (""GLM Sub III"" and together with ""GLM Master III"", collectively “GLM III”).

To mitigate this conflict, the Adviser will take deliberate actions to execute all trades with equitable pricing by implementing a strict practice of using Stop/Loss trade execution with identical prices.  However, trade execution at various firms is not always identical thus prices achieved may vary.  Furthermore, if the limit price is not available when the stop price is obtained, the Adviser will often manually trade the accounts in hopes of achieving best execution.

(3) Information as to the number and location (domicile) of investors in any of the funds may change due to sale of interests to other parties. Canaras may not track such sales or assignments. CLO notes are listed on Euronext Dublin. Sales and assignments of notes in CLOs differs from those of hedge funds. Offerings of CLO notes and equity are pursuant to their own offering memoranda and are effected through the respective dealers. Such dealers are required, under applicable FINRA and other legal requirements, to perform anti-money laundering and know your customer reviews on subscribers to CLO securities.  (4) The number of investment-related professionals is determined by assessing the involvement in portfolio decisions of each employee, and the number may fluctuate from time to time.  (5) With respect to certain CLO clients, while Canaras and Saranac have discretion to select assets for the client portfolios, trustees may veto investments if they believe that they are outside of the parameters prescribed by governing documents (such as indentures).  (6) The firm has no plans to engage in principal transactions with clients, but such may be warranted or result from structuring complex client transactions in the future.  (7) Assets Under Management (AUM) includes assets being managed during ramp-up of new CLOs, as the firm is operating under a collateral management agreement.  (8)  Cyber Security Risk - The IT systems of Canaras, its affiliates, and of service providers to its clients may be vulnerable to potential damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunication failures, infiltration by unauthorized persons (who may be both malevolent and highly sophisticated) and security breaches, power outages and catastrophic events. Although Canaras has implemented various measures designed to manage risks relating to these types of events, if these systems are compromised, become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly, it may be necessary for Canaras (and/or its service providers) to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and to seek to remedy the effect of these issues. The failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in Canaras's operations or its client accounts and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information.  (9) Saranac Management Limited and Saranac Investment Management IC (both registered in Jersey, Channel Islands) are listed on Schedule A. They hold NON-VOTING interests in Saranac CLO Management, LLC. The interests held are for limited purposes connected with certain risk retention obligations under laws of the European Union in connection with certain CLO deals/offerings. The identifier numbers on Schedule A are their Jersey (Channel Islands) corporate registration numbers.   (10) Neither Saranac nor Canaras has ""clients"" who are ""retail investors"" as those terms are defined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and under Regulation BI, nor is either firm expected to have clients who are retail investors in the foreseeable future.  (11) The receipt of audited financials for private investment companies may lag certain updating amendments to this form, or the filing of amendments may not coincide with the earlier receipt of such financials. Generally, the funds expect to receive unqualified reports. While the funds expect that audits will be completed within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year, there may be harder to value assets in the portfolio that may cause a delay in the completion of the audits. As for CLOs managed by the firm, they are not audited (though new rules may require audits), but their operations rely upon agreed upon procedures to assure the accuracy and integrity of financial records. The SEC has recently proposed rules that will require the CLOs are also audited; however, the proposed rules are not expected to become effective, if adopted, imminently.  (12) Notwithstanding other information herein under Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the PCAOB-auditor for Canaras Credit Opportunities LLC (805-7647734239) has not yet been selected. The third-party fund administrator for Canaras Credit Opportunities LLC (805-7647734239) has not yet been selected.  (13) A loan in the amount of $2 million, effected in March of 2021, exists between a senior firm executive and the firm. The purpose of the loan was to assure that the firm is able to meet certain European retention (""skin in the game"") requirements in connection with certain CLO transactions. The loan has triggers for repayment to the executive by the firm. These triggers include: (a) The firm's failure to make full and timely payment of the amounts due on any Payment Date or the Maturity Date and the failure to remedy such payment default within fourteen calendar days; or (b) The departure of Anthony R. Clemente as Chief Executive Officer of the firm; or (c) The reduction of Anthony R. Clemente's direct or indirect ownership of the firm to less than 50%; or (d) The filing of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy petition with respect to the firm in any court of competent jurisdiction.  (14) Presently, the firm is not in a ""precarious financial condition,"" nor is such condition foreseen in the near future. Should such a condition obtain, clients will be informed."

While Section 7.A. of Schedule D of this Form ADV includes the General Partner of each pooled investment vehicle reported in Section 7.B.(1) of this Form ADV, it excludes the General Partners of pooled investment vehicles advised by MSD Partners, L.P.’s related SEC-registered advisers.   Information provided in Item 5 excludes regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) attributable to an investment by one client in another client that would represent a duplication of assets already included in calculating RAUM (so that such assets are counted only once). The gross asset value reported in Question 11 of Section 7.B.(1) for each private fund excludes the gross asset value attributable to the amount invested in the private fund by another Client.  Alternative investment vehicles formed to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory or other structuring reasons are not separately reported in Section 7.B.(1) of this Form ADV and are not separately counted as “Clients” for purposes of Items 5 and 9.  Rather, information regarding such alternative investment vehicles have been aggregated with the information regarding the private funds to which such vehicles relate.  MSD Private Credit Opportunity Fund, L.P. and MSD Private Credit Opportunity Fund (Cayman), L.P.

MSD Private Credit Opportunity Fund 2, L.P. and MSD Private Credit Opportunity Fund (Cayman) 2, L.P. (“PCOF 2 Feeder Funds”) invest a substantial portion of their assets through a “master-feeder” structure and invest directly, or indirectly through subsidiaries of MSD Private Credit Opportunity Master (ECI) Fund 2, L.P (“PCOF Master ECI 2”) and MSD Private Credit Opportunity Master Fund 2, L.P. (“PCOF Master 2” together with PCOF Master ECI 2, the “PCOF Master Funds 2”).

SUCH CAMPAIGNS INVOLVE PAYMENTS FOR WEB-BASED REFERRALS BASED ON CERTAIN SEARCH-TERMS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL PLANNING OR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS.  MOST INTERNET-BASED ADVERTISING REQUIRES THE ADVERTISER TO PAY FOR THE IMPRESSIONS OR REFERRALS WHETHER OR NOT THEY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN ANY TRANSACTION (REFERRED TO AS ""CONVERSIONS"").  NORTH CAPITAL INC. IS UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH A REGISTERED BROKER DEALER, NORTH CAPITAL PRIVATE SECURITIES CORPORATION (NCPS).  NCPS IS FOCUSED ON THE ORIGINATION, DISTRIBUTION, AND CLEARING OF EXEMPT SECURITIES AND PUBLIC , NON-TRADED SECURITIES, SUCH AS THE COMMON EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES, PRIVATE REAL ESTATE OFFERINGS, AND PRIVATE FUNDS.  AS SUCH, THE CLIENT BASE OF NCPS IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND RETAIL ACCREDITED INVESTORS.   IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A CURRENT OR PROSPECTIVE CLIENT OF NORTH CAPITAL OR NCPS COULD BECOME A CLIENT OF THE OTHER, WHICH COULD GIVE RISE TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST IF NORTH CAPITAL WERE TO RECOMMEND AN INVESTMENT FOR WHICH NCPS SERVES AS PLACEMENT AGENT.      AS A MATTER OF POLICY, NORTH CAPITAL AND NCPS MITIGATE THIS POTENTIAL CONFLICT BY (1) DISCLOSING THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH INVESTMENTS IN WRITING TO ADVISORY CLIENTS; (2) EXCLUDING SUCH INVESTMENTS FROM THE LIST OF INVESTMENTS THAT MAY BE TRANSACTED FOR DISCRETIONARY ADVISORY RELATIONSHIPS, AND (3) HAVING NCPS FOREGO OR REBATE (OR FOR THE FIRM TO DISCOUNT ITS ADVISORY FEE BY AN EQUIVALENT AMOUNT) THE SALES COMMISSION, PLACEMENT FEE, OR TRAILER TO WHICH NCPS WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED IN RESPECT OF ANY PRIVATE SECURITIES TRANSACTION BY SUCH CLIENTS.  ONE OF THE FIRM'S ADVISORS, PAUL BOWERS, ALSO HOLDS IN INSURANCE LICENSE, WHICH LIKEWISE SUBJECTS HIM TO A CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN THAT COMMISSION THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO HIM FROM RECOMMENDING AN INSURANCE POLICY OR INSURANCE-BASED FINANCIAL STRUCTURE MIGHT BE GREATER THAN THE FEE HE WOULD EARN FROM PROVING ADVISORY SERVICES FOR A FEE.  WE MITIGATE THIS CONFLICT IN TWO WAYS:  1) DISCLOSING IT TO ANY CLIENTS TO WHOM BOWERS OR ANOTHER ADVISOR RECOMMENDS INSURANCE, AND 2) BY DISCOUNTING THE ADVISORY FEES OWED BY A CLIENT BY THE AMOUNT OF ANY COMMISSIONS RECEIVED BY BOWERS.   BY ELIMINATING ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO RECOMMEND AN INSURANCE PRODUCT OVER ANOTHER PRODUCT, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS EFFECTIVELY MITIGATED.   IT IS THE FIRM'S POLICY TO MITIGATE ANY OTHER REAL OR APPARENT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN A SIMILAR MANNER:  1) THROUGH DISCLOSURE;  2) THROUGH MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE REVIEW AND MITIGATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE;  AND 3) BY ENSURING THAT ANY FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR AN ADVISOR TO RECOMMEND A PARTICULAR AFFILIATED INVESTMENT PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO AN ADVISORY CLIENT  IS ELIMINATED.  NORTH CAPITAL HAS COMPLETED ITEM 8I AS A RESULT OF A REFERRAL AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER RIA.  NORTH CAPITAL HAS COMPLETED ITEM 9.A.(1) AND (2) AS A RESULT OF HAVING STANDING AUTHORITY (ALSO KNOWN AS A STANDING LETTER OF AUTHORIZATION OR “SLOA”) TO MOVE MONEY FROM ACCOUNTS OWNED BY THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS LISTED AT 9.A.(2)(B) TO PRE-DETERMINED THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNT(S).

1936829,"In reliance on SEC staff guidance, Moontower Asset Management LP is making this Form ADV filing on behalf of itself and Moontower Heritage Asset Management LLC (collectively, “Moontower”) and any affiliated private fund general partners that are investment advisers subject to the Advisers Act. The address reported in Section 1.L. of Schedule D is the corporate address for Microsoft O365 as Microsoft O365 does not disclose the address of its cloud storage facilities for security reasons. The asset amounts reported in Items 5 and 9 and Section 7.B of Schedule D are as of November 1, 2024. For one or more certain private fund clients of Moontower, Moontower has determined that it has discretionary authority over such fund’s assets, notwithstanding that the investor in that fund is entitled to an “opt-out” right that allows such investor to elect not to participate in an investment made by the fund. Entities controlled by a third-party investor in Mt Carmel Bixby N LLC and Mt Carmel Bixby PI LLC, which are reported as private funds in Schedule D Section 7.B, have made an initial capital commitment to these two private funds on a combined basis. For purposes of reporting asset amounts for such funds in Section 7.B, the commitment has been allocated 50-50 between the two funds. In addition, these two funds have certain board of director members who are affiliated with a third-party investor that is invested in such private funds and who are not affiliated with Moontower. Those board of director members are not listed in response to Question 3.(a) of Section 7.B for such funds. The general partners of Moontower-advised private funds are ultimately principally owned by Russell James Valdez and Connor Ramsay Stewart, who are listed on Schedule A, and/or entities affiliated therewith. In addition, certain other Moontower personnel and/or individuals with whom the firm has a relationship are expected to have non-controlling interests in general partner entities, including for purposes of receiving a portion of the carried interest (or similar compensation) to which such entities may be entitled. Certain funds may make investments through alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) or special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) that are formed to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory or other structuring reasons. Any such AIVs and SPVs have not been separately listed in Schedule D Section 7.B, but any assets they may hold are included in the asset values reported in Section 7.B for the reported private funds to which they relate. For private fund clients with respect to which Moontower has indicated in Section 7.B that their financial statements are subject to annual audit, the audit firm reported therein has been engaged to conduct an audit of the fund’s financial statements covering the period from the date the fund first had cash or investment activity until on or after December 31, 2024. The responses to Items 9.B(2)(b) and 9.F and Section 7.B Question 25 report information regarding the number of clients that held bank accounts with a custodian as of November 1, 2024 and regarding the custodian with which such accounts were held as of such date.

1934884,"Oaktree’s asset management business is indirectly controlled by Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC (“BOH”) (formerly known as Oaktree Capital Group, LLC) and Oaktree Capital Holdings, LLC (“OCH”) (formerly known as Atlas OCM Holdings, LLC).  A majority of Oaktree’s business is owned by Brookfield Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (collectively, “Brookfield”) and the remainder is owned by current and former Oaktree executives and employees, and certain related individuals and entities.  Brookfield’s ownership interest in Oaktree’s business is held through BOH, OCH and related entities.  Brookfield and Oaktree operate their respective investment businesses largely independently, with each operating under its own brand and led by its existing management and investment teams, and Oaktree and Brookfield generally managing their investment operations independently of each other subject to an information barrier between the firms.  Oaktree does not consider Brookfield or its affiliates to be its “advisory affiliates” or “related persons” for purposes of this Form ADV.  For more information regarding Brookfield and its affiliates, please refer to the Form ADV of Brookfield affiliated investment advisers: Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC (CRD# 110497), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Canada, LP (CRD# 151605), Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Credit), LLC (CRD# 170811), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Adviser (Private Equity), L.P.

(CRD# 312797), Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Advisor LLC (CRD# 312792), and Brookfield Renewable Energy Group LLC (CRD# 316590).  Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. (“OCGH”) holds 100% of the Class B units of OCH which, during the period (the “Initial Period”, which is more specifically described in the Form 8-K filed October 4, 2019, available through EDGAR) from September 30, 2019 through , the date on which Brookfield delivers a written election to end the Initial Period (which election cannot be delivered before September 30, 2026 unless certain events occur before then), entitle OCGH to 10 votes per Class B unit on all matters to be submitted to a vote of the OCH members. In addition, during the Initial Period, the board of directors of Atlas OCM is comprised of two individuals selected by OCGH, two selected by Brookfield, and the remaining directors nominated by OCGH and subject to joint written appointment by each of OCGH and Brookfield.  As a result, during the Initial Period, OCGH will maintain actual control of Atlas OCM and, indirectly, the Registrant, although Atlas OCM is permitted to take certain actions without the consent of Brookfield.  The General Partner of the Limited Partnerships listed in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has the authority to waive the minimum investment requirement. Some of the Limited Partnerships for which the Registrant acts as General Partner or Investment Adviser are closed-end limited partnerships. As such, clients are not solicited to invest in such closed-end limited partnerships after the final closing has occurred. We have excluded from our disclosure limited partnerships and/or limited liability companies organized and operated solely for the benefit of our employees as well as any special purpose vehicles that were formed in relation to a specific investment or private fund.  For certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) of schedule D that are denominated in Euro, the Gross Asset Value and minimum investment commitment values have been converted to USD for purposes of reporting.  For all private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value has been rounded to the nearest thousands.  For purposes of Item 5: Information About Your Advisory Business – Regulatory Assets Under Management, Oaktree advises certain funds of funds that invest solely in other private funds advised by Oaktree, as noted in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. for purposes of calculating Regulatory Assets Under Management as reported in Item 5 and reporting of the Gross Asset Value of private funds in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the limited partner interests held in the other Oaktree private funds by the funds of funds have been excluded from the Gross Asset Values of such funds of funds.  As such, the Gross Asset Value of such funds of funds may be reported as zero in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), if such funds of funds have no other assets other than the limited partner interests in the other Oaktree private funds. In addition, feeder funds are consolidated with the main fund to which they relate for purposes of financial statement reporting. Therefore, for purposes of reporting Gross Asset Values for feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value for the feeder fund is included in Gross Asset Value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. For purposes of calculating the gross asset values in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), any uncalled commitment amounts are not included for each relevant private fund.  For purposes of reporting beneficial owners, for the feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the number of beneficial owners for the feeder fund is included in the beneficial owner value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund.  Note that Oaktree Capital Management (UK) LLP, Oaktree Capital Management (Dubai) Limited, Oaktree Capital (Hong Kong) Limited and Oaktree Japan, Inc. which act as marketers for certain private funds reported on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), do not conduct any respective marketing activities in the United States.   All funds with financial statements subject to an annual audit, listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), are audited by the same overarching auditing firm; however, in circumstances where the main fund and feeder fund are audited by entities of such auditing firm in separate jurisdictions, the specific entity auditing the feeder is not separately disclosed. The General Partner of certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) may make an investment through an Oaktree or Oaktree affiliate-managed Alternative Investment Vehicle (""AIV""). Each AIV is governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially similar to those of the fund to which they relate. Investments made through the AIVS are funded by contributions either directly to these entities or contributions to the funds to which they relate that are subsequently transferred to the AIV, such that in both cases investors will directly own a limited partnership interest in the AIV. Financial results for each AIV are reported on a consolidated basis with the fund to which they relate.  For certain private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) that are securitized asset funds, senior noteholders are treated as creditors while the income noteholders (who possess an equity-like claim on fund assets) are treated as beneficial owners of the fund for purposes of Ownership questions 13-16. In addition, for certain securitized asset funds, registrant has responded “No” to questions 23(G) and (H) due to the fact that such private funds do not obtain unaudited financial statements and thus the questions are not applicable.  For certain master funds included in Section 7.B.(1) that are part of master-feeder arrangements, we do not solicit clients to invest at the master fund level and therefore have answered “No” for Question A.19 of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds.  However, as the marketing materials and private placement memorandums include information regarding the fund complex as a whole (i.e. the master fund in a master-feeder arrangement appears in such documents along with the relevant feeder funds, even though no investors can invest directly in the master fund and may only invest in the fund complex through a feeder fund), we have answered “Yes” for Question B.28.(a) of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. For any other-than-annual amendment where we are adding private fund(s) to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the data reported is as of the last day of the prior fiscal quarter month end date.  All other responses are as of the last day of the prior fiscal year.  Please note that Oaktree Gardens OLP SPV, LP included in Section 7.B.(1) is a feeder fund to the Oaktree Gardens OLP, LLC which is a BDC managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. This feeder fund has been excluded from Regulatory Assets Under Management as those assets are reported in the Regulatory Assets Under Management for Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC.  Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC is a relying adviser structured as a limited liability company with multiple series. Identified in Section 4.A.2 of Schedule R are the direct owners of the management series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. The other series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC hold passive interests that do not confer control over the investment advisory activities of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. Accordingly, the owners of such other series have not been listed as direct owners in Section 4.A.2."

Braidwell Partners Master Fund LP is the main master fund, which is why it was added to question Item7.B.1.6(d) for both Braidwell Partners (US) LP and Braidwell Partners LP. Likewise, with respect to the structure of Braidwell Companion CMV LP and Braidwell Companion CMV (US) LP listed in Item 7.B.1, capital from each fund flows into Braidwell Companion CMV Master Fund LP and Braidwell Companion CMV Transaction Master Fund LP depending on the investment being made.

Centerbridge Flex Partners, L.P. and Centerbridge Flex Partners Cayman, L.P. will invest their investable assets, either directly or indirectly, in Centerbridge Flex Partners Master, L.P.  |  ""Type of fund"": While certain private funds identified in ADV Part 1A are closed-end funds that pursue private equity investment strategies, such funds are classified as ""hedge funds"" in response to question 10 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 pursuant to the definition of ""hedge fund"" found in the instructions to Form ADV Part 1A and to conform to Form PF classifications.  |  Regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”), private fund gross asset values, and the amount of client funds for which the Registrant and its related persons have custody are reported as of 12/31/2023 (except as otherwise noted herein). Martello Re Limited, a reinsurance vehicle formed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”), commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2021; Centerbridge Martello Advisors, L.L.C. and Barings LLC (which is affiliated with MassMutual but not with the Registrant) both provide investment advisory services in a joint-venture arrangement. In the case of the Martello Re structure, assets from SC IV, CB Martello Feeder, L.P., CB Martello SBS, L.P., BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC – Martello Re Series and BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust – Martello Re Sub-Trust also are reflected in the RAUM attributed to insurance company clients in light of the different nature of the advisory mandates and distinct associated advisory fees payable to the applicable advisers For purposes of Section 5.K.(1) of Schedule D, Centerbridge is including in the breakdown of asset types for Martello Re those assets custodied by Centerbridge. CB LDV Co-Invest, L.P. - Series A, CP Argo Marina Holdings, L.P. and Centerbridge Capital Partners V - N Co-Invest, L.P. received commitments, and commenced or will commence operations as private funds, after 12/31/2023, thus for all the gross asset value reported in response to question 11 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 is zero. The assets under management calculation, as expressed in ADV Part 2A, applies a different methodology that results in a figure different from regulatory assets under management.  |  The 12/ 17/2020 Amendment to this Form ADV included changes to reflect the retirement of Mark Gallogly in December 2020. In the case of certain entities, ownership (including capital) of limited partnership interests results in “Control Person” status in certain sections of Schedule R. The Registrant notes that as it relates to disclosures in Schedule A, Vivek Melwani does not have a middle name or middle initial.  |  With respect to Item 6, the Registrant may from time to time have its employees or other representatives on the boards of directors and/or other committees, or acting in management roles, of certain companies in which one or more private funds are invested.  |  With respect to the questions regarding the Registrant’s related persons in Item 7, certain companies owned by Registrant’s related persons are, or may become, during the course of the related person’s investment, involved in financial services and/or investment advisory activities, which may include status as broker-dealers, investment companies or other pooled investment vehicles or investment advisers, among other things. The Registrant formed collateralized bond obligation (CBO) vehicles Centerbridge Credit Funding 1, Ltd. and Centerbridge Credit Funding II, Ltd. and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) vehicles Park Blue CLO 2022-I, Ltd., Park Blue CLO 2022-II, Ltd., Park Blue CLO 2023-III, Ltd. and Park Blue CLO 2023-IV, Ltd. (“CLO IV”) (the aforementioned CBO and CLO vehicles, collectively, the “CDO Vehicles”). As of Registrant’s last Form ADV annual filing, SC IV owned equity in CLO IV and Centerbridge Special Credit III-Flex, L.P. owned equity in the other CDO Vehicles. Centerbridge Credit Funding Advisors, LLC, which is identified in this Form ADV as a relying adviser of the Registrant, provides advisory services to the CDO Vehicles, and may in the future provide advisory services to other vehicles that are similar in nature.  |  Responses to question 13 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 include where applicable investors who have made capital commitments that have not had capital called. Centerbridge Flex Partners Master, L.P., Centerbridge Flex Partners, L.P., Centerbridge Flex Partners Cayman, L.P., Centerbridge Capital Partners V, L.P., Centerbridge FP Co-Invest Fund, L.P., CB LDV Co-Invest, L.P. - Series A, CP Argo Marina Holdings, L.P. and Centerbridge Capital Partners V - N Co-Invest, L.P. commenced or will commence operations as private funds after 12/31/2023 and, consequently, the calculation of net asset values (“NAV”) for these private funds would yield a result that the Registrant does not consider to be meaningful; therefore, questions 14 through 16 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1, which are calculated based on NAV, show zero as responses for such private funds. In the case of Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P. and Centerbridge Capital Partners Strategic, L.P., which are in late harvest, Registrant has provisionally responded with zero percent to question 14 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1. to reflect that, while the General Partner has a capital interest in each, there may at the time of ultimate disposition of such private funds’ remaining assets and completion of waterfall calculations be required a return of a portion of carried interest previously distributed.  The responses in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 pertaining to BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series and BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust are provided in reliance on information provided by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., which Registrant has not itself independently verified. Per Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA); however, the trust’s sub-trusts, including Martello Re Sub-Trust, are not separately registered with CIMA, therefore the Registrant has not listed CIMA in the response to question 5 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1. for BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust.  |  The Registrant is affiliated with Overland Advisors, LLC, with which the Registrant has a relationship, including the provision of resources pursuant to a resource sharing agreement. Overland Advisors, LLC has been formed to provide investment advice to a business development company and is a separate investment adviser with its own Form ADV filing (https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/325525).   |  The 8/23/2024 Amendment to this Form ADV was filed in part for the purpose of generating private fund identification numbers (“PF IDs”), as required for Form PF, for (i) CB LDV Co-Invest, L.P. - Series B and (ii) Overland Advantage Feeder Fund, L.P., both of which are reporting certain data as of 6/30/2024. The 11/21/2024 Amendment was filed in part for the purpose of generating PF IDs, as required for Form PF, for (i) CP Argo Marina Holdings (Cayman), L.P., which is reporting certain data as of 6/30/2024, and for (ii) Centerbridge Special Credit Partners IV - I Co-Invest, L.P. - Series C and (iii) Overland Advantage SBS, L.P., both of which are reporting certain data as of 9/30/2024. The 1/3/2025 Amendment updated Section 1.L. of Schedule D. This 2/25/2025 Amendment was filed in part for the purpose of generating PF IDs, as required for Form PF, for (i) CB Atlantic II Co-Invest, L.P. and (ii) BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series II, both of which are reporting certain data as of 9/30/2024, and for (iii) Park Blue CLO 2024-V, Ltd. and (iv) CB Martello Feeder II, L.P., both of which are reporting certain data as of 12/31/2024."

Each Relying Adviser will conduct its investment advisory activities in accordance with the Act and the policies and procedures of the Filing Adviser, and each Relying Adviser's employees and activities will be subject to the Filing Adviser's supervision and control. The Crestline Canada entities have their principal place of business in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Crestline Canada entities are owned as set forth in the Filing Adviser’s brochure. Thru line, L.P., a limited partner in the Filing Adviser and an affiliated general partner holding company, does not have a management function or control of the Filing Adviser. As such, Thru Line, L.P. is not listed on Schedule A as a Control Person. Certain listed owners acquired their status as limited partners effective as of January 1, 2021. Crestline Europe, LLP is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and is a Participating Affiliate.  Bratton Capital Management, L.P. is also a Relying Adviser; it and Bratton Capital, Inc. are related persons of Filing Adviser and serve as general partners to or manage limited partnerships that are not listed in response to section 7.B.(2). of this Schedule D because they are special purpose vehicles for family office investments managed by Bratton Capital Management, L.P. (as opposed to investment vehicles offered by the Filing Adviser). The Filing Adviser agrees to provide a list of such limited partnerships and their general partners upon request.  Crestline Associates Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of the Filing Adviser, has an indirect ownership interest in Crestline Denali Capital, LLC (“Denali”). As such, principal owners of the Filing Adviser have an indirect ownership interest in Denali. The Filing Adviser has direct and indirect ownership interests of SummitTX Capital, L.P. (“SummitTX”), a separately registered investment adviser.  As of 1/2/2025, certain funds managed by the Filing Adviser (generally related to its hedge fund strategy) are managed by SummitTX.  Such funds are included in Section 7.B.(1) of this filing to enable the Filing Adviser to file its Q4 2024 Form PF report which has a Reporting Date of 12/31/2024. Assets under management amounts are as of December 31, 2023, March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024, as applicable and include estimates where final values were not yet available. Investment funds were added to or removed from Schedule 7.B.(1) if they were launched or closed in 2024. The stated minimum investment amounts may be lower for certain investors. The Reporting Funds Crestline Opportunity Fund III (Europe) Master Fund D SCSP, Crestline Opportunity IV Master Fund, L.P., Crestline Opportunity Fund V Master Fund, L.P. and Crestline StepStone Opportunistic Credit Master Fund I, L.P. are each part of fund structures where there are multiple ""Master"" funds to various ""Feeder"" funds. Capital commitments from investors into those ""Feeder"" funds can ultimately be invested into any of the Master Funds within the respective Master-Feeder structure, depending on the characteristics of the underlying investments. Since we do not expect these ""Feeder” funds to invest substantially all of their assets into any of the “Master” funds, we do not characterize the relationship as a Master-Feeder relationship per Form ADV instructions. In each case, when we commence reporting of performance to investors, we will report an aggregate return to investors based on the consolidated performance of all of the related master funds. We believe this approach better reflects how investors view the investment (i.e., as an investment into one fund based on one capital commitment rather than an investment into multiple funds).  Each of CL Commonwealth, Inc. and CL Trading, L.P. is an SPV which we treat as a fund due to the SEC’s guidance on application of the custody rule to SPVs which include managed accounts as investors in the SPVs.  Aggregate returns are reported to the investors in the funds or managed accounts comprising the investors in these SPVs, but separate returns by investment are not reported.  Crestline Menlo Fund, L.P., Crestline Offshore Menlo Fund, L.P., Crestline Recovery Fund II, L.P., Crestline Recovery Fund III, L.P., and CL Recovery Trading Fund III, L.P. have taken certain corporate actions to facilitate the sale or liquidation of certain positions in connection with their winding down.  Due to some of the structuring changes, the Reporting Funds Crestline Menlo Fund, L.P., Crestline Offshore Menlo Fund, L.P., Crestline Recovery Fund II, L.P. and Crestline Recovery Fund III, L.P. are now “Master” funds. For funds launched in 2024 we answer “yes” to question 23(g) in schedule 7.B.(1) as it is expected audited financial statements will be distributed to the respective private funds’ investors for the fiscal year. Lastly, in response to item 5.E.(7) certain client accounts pay the investment manager for certain investment manager expenses as disclosed in the relevant account documentation."

PwC informed the Adviser that a member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited performed non-audit services for an entity acquired by a non-U.S.-domiciled portfolio company controlled by certain funds managed by the Adviser. Following this acquisition, from December 2022 to January 2023, such member firm provided legal services, which services are inconsistent with the auditor independence rules pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(4)(ix) of Regulation S-X. The fees incurred for these services after the entity became an affiliate of the HPS Relevant Funds were approximately $7,500.  PwC communicated the facts and circumstances surrounding these services to the Adviser, including the scope and duration of these services, the associated fees incurred by PwC and the steps taken to terminate the impermissible services. PwC also noted the identified services did not have any direct accounting impact on the financial results of the HPS Relevant Funds.

However, clients who hire Tingey Advisors, Inc. to manage their portfolio, may from time to time set up a standing letter of authorization with the custodian to facilitate the movement of money from their custodial account to another account that the client specifies in writing.    Furthermore, the client may from time to time authorize Tingey Advisors, Inc. to initiate the movement of money through said standing letter of authorization via ACH transfer, check, or journal transfer, to an account prescribed by the client.  Under the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 206(4)-2, this constitutes Tingey Advisors, Inc. having custody of those assets.  Tingey Advisors, Inc., does not accept standing letters of authorization set up by client with the custodian with respect to first party or third-party wire transfers.  Any wire transfer made from client account will require specific written instruction in a form acceptable to the custodian, by the client at the time of the wire transfer.  In the event that the client sets up a standing letter of authorization for the movement of money via ACH transfer, check, or journal to another account, and gives Tingey Advisors, Inc. authorization to initiate those transactions, TA will only act on the authorization if a client’s respective custodian certifies that it meets #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #7 of the following conditions -- Tingey Advisors, Inc. meets condition #6.  1.	  The client provides an instruction to the qualified custodian, in writing, that includes the client’s signature, the third party’s name, and either the third party’s address or the third party’s account number at a custodian to which the transfer should be directed. 2.	The client authorizes TA, in writing, either on the qualified custodian’s form or separately, to direct transfers to the third party either on a specified schedule or from time to time. 3.	The client’s qualified custodian performs appropriate verification of the instruction, such as a signature review or other method to verify the client’s authorization, and provides a transfer of funds notice to the client promptly after each transfer. 4.	The client has the ability to terminate or change the instruction to the clients qualified custodian. 5.	TA has no authority or ability to designate or change the identity of the third party, the address, or any other information about the third party contained in the client’s instruction.   6.	 TA maintains records showing that the third party is not a related party of TA or located at the same address as TA. 7.

Due to IARD system requirements, the firm reported the change using “succession by amendment” filing procedures in order to make the state change.  Please note however that although SVRN has domesticated from Illinois to Texas,  an actual succession event did not result. The entity never dissolved, and no new entity was created. It kept the same control, leadership, and ownership.

A succession occurs when ""the previous organization"" is dissolved, and a new legal entity ""has taken over the business of the previous organization."" Id.   The SEC defers to state law in cases of domestication to determine whether a previous organization has dissolved, and a new legal entity has been created.  The relevant Illinois and Texas statutes assert that domestication is a process that allows the same entity to persist through time, without dissolution. 805 Ill. Comp. Stat. 415/306 (2017); Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code Ann. § 10.106 (2021). That is, the domestication does not create a new legal entity, nor dissolve any old entity.

However, trade execution at various firms is not always identical thus prices achieved may vary.  Furthermore, if the limit price is not available when the stop price is obtained, the Adviser will often manually trade the accounts in hopes of achieving best execution.

1930140,"Re Item 5.D, Item 5.F and Section 7.B.1  The TP Fund L.P. (“TP Fund”) invests substantially all of its respective assets in other Taconic funds.  Therefore, we have not included TP Fund’s investments in such funds in computing assets for Item 5.D, Item 5.F and 7.B.1 because such inclusion would result in double counting of assets.    Re Section 7.B.1: (1)   Taconic Capital Advisors L.P. (“TCA LP”), the filing adviser, and Taconic Capital Advisors UK LLP (“TCAUK”) (a “Relying Adviser”), are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance upon guidance from the SEC and the Form ADV instructions.   TCA LP has listed TCAUK as a relying adviser in Schedule R of this Form ADV.  All Funds for which TCAUK serves as subadvisor are listed in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D of this Form ADV.  TCAUK is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom.   On January 1, 2008, Taconic Opportunity Offshore Fund Ltd. began conducting all of its investment and trading activities through Taconic Opportunity Master Fund L.P. (“TOMF”).   On July 1, 2013, Taconic Opportunity Fund L.P., began conducting a substantial portion of its respective investment operations indirectly via an investment in TOMF.  In addition, Taconic Opportunity Offshore Fund Ltd. began investing in TOMF indirectly through Taconic Opportunity Offshore Intermediate Fund L.P.     Taconic European Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund II L.P. and Taconic European Credit Dislocation Fund II L.P. conduct all of their investment and trading activities directly through an investment in Taconic European Credit Dislocation Master Fund II L.P.  Accordingly, substantially all of the assets of each Master Fund identified in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are those of the corresponding feeder funds.  Taconic European Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund III L.P. and Taconic European Credit Dislocation Fund III L.P. conduct all of their investment and trading activities directly through an investment in Taconic European Credit Dislocation Master Fund III L.P.  Accordingly, substantially all of the assets of each Master Fund identified in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are those of the corresponding feeder funds.  Taconic European Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund IV L.P. and Taconic European Credit Dislocation Fund IV  L.P. conduct all of their investment and trading activities directly through an investment in Taconic European Credit Dislocation Master Fund III L.P.  Accordingly, substantially all of the assets of each Master Fund identified in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are those of the corresponding feeder funds. All the feeder funds’ prime brokers and custodians are listed in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D. Each master-feeder arrangement is reported using a single Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) unless otherwise noted.    The TP Fund invests substantially all of its respective assets in other Taconic funds.    Taconic Market Dislocation Master Fund III (Cayman) L.P. is a master fund of a master-feeder arrangement.  Taconic Market Dislocation Fund III AIV I (Cayman) L.P is a master fund of a master-feeder arrangement.  Taconic Market Dislocation Onshore Fund III L.P. and Taconic Market Dislocation Fund (Cayman) III L.P. (each, a “feeder fund”, and together, the “feeder funds”) invest in Taconic Market Dislocation Master Fund III (Cayman) L.P.  and Taconic Market Dislocation Fund III AIV I (Cayman) L.P. (each, a “master fund”, and together, the “master funds”). Given that the feeder funds invest in two separate master funds, each feeder fund is reported separately in Section 7.B.1.  Taconic Credit Dislocation Fund IV L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and Taconic Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund IV L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, both of which invest using a master-feeder structure through Taconic Credit Dislocation Master Fund IV L.P. (the “CDF Master Fund IV”).  Taconic Credit Dislocation Fund IV L.P and Taconic Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund IV L.P. also invest through a number of subsidiaries.  Taconic Merger Arbitrage Master Fund L.P. is a master fund of a master-feeder arrangement.  Taconic Merger Arbitrage Fund L.P. and Taconic Merger Arbitrage Offshore Fund Ltd. invest in the Taconic Merger Arbitrage Master Fund L.P.    The total regulatory assets under management numbers are as of December 31, 2023.  All the funds’ gross asset values in question 11 of Section 7.B.1 are also as of December 31, 2023, except for the funds that were launched after December 31, 2023.  The Merger Dislocation Fund was launched in April 2024 and its assets are as of June 30, 2024.  The European Credit Dislocation Fund IV was launched in October 2024 and its assets are as of December 31, 2024.  The CRE Dislocation Fund IV was launched in July 2024 and its assets are as of December 31, 2024.  The CRE Dislocation Overflow Fund IV was launched in September 2024 and its assets are as of December 31, 2024.    Re Section 7.B.(1)(28):  Taconic had entered into a term sheet to engage Mercury Capital Advisors (“Mercury”) to serve as a placement agent for Taconic CRE Dislocation Onshore Fund IV L.P.; however, Mercury went out of business prior to the execution of a final engagement agreement. Taconic did not pay Mercury any placement agent fees and Taconic no longer has any business with Mercury.  Re Schedule A:   Schedule A requires the full legal name (first, middle and last name) of each executive officer and direct owner.  Flaurine St Louis does not have a middle name.  As such, there is no middle name listed in Schedule A for Flaurine St Louis."

In each case, when we commence reporting of performance to investors, we will report an aggregate return to investors based on the consolidated performance of both Master Funds. We believe this approach better reflects how investors view the investment (i.e., as an investment into one fund based on one capital commitment rather than an investment into multiple funds).  GoldenTree has six affiliated, U.S.-based relying advisers, GoldenTree Loan Management, LP (""GLM Master"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM, LP (""GLM Sub"" and together with ""GLM Master"", collectively “GLM”), GoldenTree Loan Management II LP (""GLM Master II"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM II, LP (""GLM Sub II"" and together with ""GLM Master II"", collectively “GLM II”) and GoldenTree Loan Management III LP (""GLM Master III"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM III, LP (""GLM Sub III"" and together with ""GLM Master III"", collectively “GLM III”).   Each of GLM, GLM II and GLM III have been formed to manage vehicles investing primarily in senior secured debt obligations, most or all of which will be in the form of CLOs, and to perform related functions. Prior to the formation of GLM Sub, GLM Sub II, and GLM Sub III, the CLOs received management services from GLM Master, GLM Master II and GLM Master III, which management services have been transitioned to GLM Sub, GLM Sub II and GLM Sub III, respectively."

The client authorizes the investment adviser, in writing, either on the qualified custodian’s form or separately, to direct transfers to the third party either on a specified schedule or from time to time. 3. The client’s qualified custodian performs appropriate verification of the instruction, such as a signature review or other method to verify the client’s authorization, and provides a transfer of funds notice to the client promptly after each transfer. 4. The client has the ability to terminate or change the instruction to the client’s qualified custodian. 5. The investment adviser has no authority or ability to designate or change the identity of the third party, the address, or any other information about the third party contained in the client’s instruction. 6. The investment adviser maintains records showing that the third party is not a related party of the investment adviser or located at the same address as the investment adviser. 7.

PwC communicated the facts and circumstances surrounding this service to the Adviser, including the scope and duration of this service and the associated fees incurred by PwC. PwC also noted the identified service did not have any direct accounting impact on the financial results of the BlackRock Relevant funds.

1939681,"For Schedule D, Section 1.F, there are certain locations where Global Infrastructure Management, LLC and its affiliates (“GIM”) operate its business without physical addresses or dedicated space including (i) Singapore and (ii) Dallas, Texas. In addition, GIM maintains a liaison office in Seoul, Korea, and certain private funds maintain a Luxembourg office for regulatory local presence requirements. GIM can provide additional information regarding these locations upon request. For Item 5, regulatory assets under management reflect the gross aggregate value of the assets held by private funds and separately managed accounts as of year-end plus unfunded capital commitments. GIM forms special purpose vehicles to serve as the general partners or managing members of certain private funds managed by GIM and are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC letter addressed to the American Bar Association’s Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities dated October 8, 2005, as updated on January 18, 2012. From time to time, certain private funds and separately managed accounts make investments through alternative investment vehicles and holding companies (collectively “AIVs”) that GIM forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory, or other structuring reasons. The AIVs have not been separately reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), but information regarding the AIVs has been aggregated with the private funds or separately managed accounts to which they relate. Regulatory assets under management and gross asset values are estimated and unaudited and may differ materially from the final audited amounts. Certain entities recently formed or being wound down with gross asset values of zero or near zero as of year-end are not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1). However, committed capital that has not been called by certain such recently formed entities is included in the amount of regulatory assets under management in Item 5 and the information provided in Item 9. In addition, these entities are included the number of clients managed by GIM. Where applicable, regulatory assets under management and gross asset values have been converted from EURO, INR, GBP, and AUD to USD based on the 12/31/2023 Spot Rate. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), the total commitment amount for each private fund was used to calculate the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), a private fund’s general partner (or similar managing entity) is not counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13, and the general partner’s commitment amount is excluded when calculating the percentages for the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), where applicable, investors in a private fund who have made capital commitments but have not yet had capital called are counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), due to the structural overlap of certain private funds, separately managed accounts, and co-investment clients, GIM answered in the negative for Question 19 and indicated zero percent for Question 20 as it believes that such structural overlap does not constitute a solicitation of any such client or investment by any such client into a private fund. For purposes of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), in response to Question 28, GIM indicated “Yes” for private funds that are currently in an active fundraising period utilizing a third-party placement agent, and “No” for private funds that previously employed a third-party placement agent but whose fundraising period has ended. Global Infrastructure Partners Singapore Manager Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIM, is not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.A. This entity is a sub-manager to certain non-US private funds and separately managed accounts and receives management fees from such entities, but does not conduct any investment advisory services. GIP IV Cavalry Co-Invest II, L.P. is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). This entity is an investment-specific vehicle whose sole beneficial owner is Infra Investors II Co-Invest, L.P., a private fund listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). Global Infrastructure Partners IV-C / C2 AIV, L.P. was formed for investment structuring purposes and is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). However, its beneficial owners are investors in other Global Infrastructure Partners IV private funds, which are listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). For purposes of Item 8.A.(1), from time to time, GIM warehouses investments for certain private funds that have not been formed or have not closed when the investments are made. Once formed, GIM transfers the investments to the respective private funds pursuant to their governing documents.  GIM discloses these warehousing arrangements and the corresponding risks to prospective investors within the relevant private placement memoranda. For purposes of Item 8.A.(2), certain of GIM’s principals and employees invest in the same investments as the private funds (including co-investments) through such funds’ general partner entities or dedicated “friends and family” vehicles. Certain private funds and separately managed accounts hold public securities indirectly at Caixa Bank. For Schedule D, Section 1.L., certain service providers that maintain GIM’s books and records have cloud-based storage. The books and records can be accessed from the GIM offices. GIM does not disclose the exact addresses and information of our books and records service providers and/or cloud-based storage providers for cybersecurity reasons. Conventional rounding methods were used to report the percentages when required to provide a percentage, as decimal amounts cannot be entered."

This law prohibits Candriam from asking Candriam EOPDs to respond to the majority of questions in Item 11. Even for those questions where Candriam may ask its Candriam EOPDs for their responses, the law prohibits the disclosure of information that otherwise would be provided in the relevant Disclosure Reporting Page of this Form without further safeguards in place for the transfer of personal data.  "" Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1): The private funds are registered in several jurisdictions. We have listed the primary jurisdictions of regulation only in response to question 5. With respect to question 12 for the funds, there is no minimum investment commitment for the funds in which we answered ""$1,"" therefore the amount invested by investors are under their discretion and can vary significantly between investors. The figures reported in response to question 13 for the private funds are based on information available to Candriam, considering that it has a detailed view on the clients and distributors to which it sells fund interests directly, but has no information on the number of beneficial owners to whom its third party distributors sell its funds in certain non-US markets. Therefore, this approximate number of beneficial owners refers to the number of end investors and non-US distributors invested in the fund with which Candriam has a direct relationship. The figures reported in response to question 15 for the private funds take into account the percentage of the fund owned by Candriam managed funds of funds. Due to the manner in which underlying Candriam funds are distributed and held in markets outside the United States where their shares are sold, however, Candriam is not currently able to provide specific information regarding the percentage of third-party fund of funds that may invest in a given Candriam fund. For the purposes of responding to question 20, Candriam has calculated the figures as a percentage of total clients. Candriam has responded ""no"" to question 28, except for two funds. Except for these two funds, Candriam does not use any third parties to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. However, Candriam enlists several regulated distributors for the purpose of selling the funds in non-US markets in accordance with the requirements of applicable (non-US) regulations. Candriam does not use a website to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. It understands that distributors located outside the United States are expected to target their marketing efforts exclusively to non-US investors in their home markets. Non US distributors may use websites targeted to investors in non-US jurisdictions for the purpose of distributing shares of Candriam funds.  Form ADV-NR: Candriam is neither a partnership nor an unincorporated business association and thus does not consider itself to be required to File Form ADV-NR in connection with its registration. Candriam has however signed the non-resident adviser execution page, and, as disclosed in Schedule B, it is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a company organized and operating in the United States. With regard to the information listed in Schedule B, please note that New York Life Insurance Company is a mutual life insurance company and does not have shareholders.
