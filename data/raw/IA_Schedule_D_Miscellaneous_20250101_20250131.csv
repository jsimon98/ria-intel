Investment Grade Corporate Bonds include corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of BBB or higher and a Moody’s rating of Baa or higher. Corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of below BBB or a Moody’s rating below Baa are categorized as Non-Investment Grade Corporate Bonds.  Those securities given opposing ratings by Moody’s and S&P (investment-grade and non-investment grade) automatically default to the non-investment grade category.  3.

The address reported in Section 1.L. of Schedule D is the corporate address for Microsoft O365 as Microsoft O365 does not disclose the address of its cloud storage facilities for security reasons. The asset amounts reported in Items 5 and 9 and Section 7.B of Schedule D are as of November 1, 2024. For one or more certain private fund clients of Moontower, Moontower has determined that it has discretionary authority over such fund’s assets, notwithstanding that the investor in that fund is entitled to an “opt-out” right that allows such investor to elect not to participate in an investment made by the fund. Entities controlled by a third-party investor in Mt Carmel Bixby N LLC and Mt Carmel Bixby PI LLC, which are reported as private funds in Schedule D Section 7.B, have made an initial capital commitment to these two private funds on a combined basis. For purposes of reporting asset amounts for such funds in Section 7.B, the commitment has been allocated 50-50 between the two funds. In addition, these two funds have certain board of director members who are affiliated with a third-party investor that is invested in such private funds and who are not affiliated with Moontower. Those board of director members are not listed in response to Question 3.(a) of Section 7.B for such funds. The general partners of Moontower-advised private funds are ultimately principally owned by Russell James Valdez and Connor Ramsay Stewart, who are listed on Schedule A, and/or entities affiliated therewith. In addition, certain other Moontower personnel and/or individuals with whom the firm has a relationship are expected to have non-controlling interests in general partner entities, including for purposes of receiving a portion of the carried interest (or similar compensation) to which such entities may be entitled. Certain funds may make investments through alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) or special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) that are formed to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory or other structuring reasons. Any such AIVs and SPVs have not been separately listed in Schedule D Section 7.B, but any assets they may hold are included in the asset values reported in Section 7.B for the reported private funds to which they relate. For private fund clients with respect to which Moontower has indicated in Section 7.B that their financial statements are subject to annual audit, the audit firm reported therein has been engaged to conduct an audit of the fund’s financial statements covering the period from the date the fund first had cash or investment activity until on or after December 31, 2024. The responses to Items 9.B(2)(b) and 9.F and Section 7.B Question 25 report information regarding the number of clients that held bank accounts with a custodian as of November 1, 2024 and regarding the custodian with which such accounts were held as of such date.

This law prohibits Candriam from asking Candriam EOPDs to respond to the majority of questions in Item 11. Even for those questions where Candriam may ask its Candriam EOPDs for their responses, the law prohibits the disclosure of information that otherwise would be provided in the relevant Disclosure Reporting Page of this Form without further safeguards in place for the transfer of personal data.  "" Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1): The private funds are registered in several jurisdictions. We have listed the primary jurisdictions of regulation only in response to question 5. With respect to question 12 for the funds, there is no minimum investment commitment for the funds in which we answered ""$1,"" therefore the amount invested by investors are under their discretion and can vary significantly between investors. The figures reported in response to question 13 for the private funds are based on information available to Candriam, considering that it has a detailed view on the clients and distributors to which it sells fund interests directly, but has no information on the number of beneficial owners to whom its third party distributors sell its funds in certain non-US markets. Therefore, this approximate number of beneficial owners refers to the number of end investors and non-US distributors invested in the fund with which Candriam has a direct relationship. The figures reported in response to question 15 for the private funds take into account the percentage of the fund owned by Candriam managed funds of funds. Due to the manner in which underlying Candriam funds are distributed and held in markets outside the United States where their shares are sold, however, Candriam is not currently able to provide specific information regarding the percentage of third-party fund of funds that may invest in a given Candriam fund. For the purposes of responding to question 20, Candriam has calculated the figures as a percentage of total clients. Candriam has responded ""no"" to question 28, except for two funds. Except for these two funds, Candriam does not use any third parties to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. However, Candriam enlists several regulated distributors for the purpose of selling the funds in non-US markets in accordance with the requirements of applicable (non-US) regulations. Candriam does not use a website to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. It understands that distributors located outside the United States are expected to target their marketing efforts exclusively to non-US investors in their home markets. Non US distributors may use websites targeted to investors in non-US jurisdictions for the purpose of distributing shares of Candriam funds.  Form ADV-NR: Candriam is neither a partnership nor an unincorporated business association and thus does not consider itself to be required to File Form ADV-NR in connection with its registration. Candriam has however signed the non-resident adviser execution page, and, as disclosed in Schedule B, it is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a company organized and operating in the United States. With regard to the information listed in Schedule B, please note that New York Life Insurance Company is a mutual life insurance company and does not have shareholders.

1930981,"The registrant shares investment staff with certain non-US affiliated entities, and the registrant has included all such personnel in its responses to Item 5.A and Item 5.B. Certain advisory clients are structured as a fund established for a single investor or a group of affiliated investors and for purposes of Form ADV Part 1A are treated (i) as a pooled investment vehicle and (ii) as a private fund only to the extent it relies on either of the exemptions provided by 3(c)1 or 3(c)7 of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.  Certain of these private fund advisory clients were established for non-U.S. third-party investors that have expressly requested that the advisory client prepare annual audited financial statements in accordance with accounting principles other than U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (e.g., International Financial Reporting Standards). Certain advisory clients have the right to opt-out of certain investment opportunities under certain circumstances. Notwithstanding any such opt-out rights, the registrant classifies such client accounts as discretionary. Related persons of the registrant who serve as general partners, commodity pool operators or managers of pooled investment vehicles or as other investment advisers that are not listed on section 7.A. of this Schedule D are listed on the Form ADV of one or more of the following affiliated investment advisers that are separately registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): (i)AlpInvest Partners B.V. (SEC File no. 801- 72890); (ii) AlpInvest Private Equity Investment Management, LLC (SEC file no. 801-126208); (iii) Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-50462); and (iv) Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-77691).  The minimum investment commitment indicated for any private fund may be reduced in the discretion of the applicable general partner or the registrant.  Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have limited partners which are themselves pooled investment vehicles established and controlled by a third-party not affiliated with the registrant.  While any such vehicle may have invested all, or substantially all, of its assets into the private fund, the registrant deems such vehicles to be a “fund-of-funds” rather than a “feeder fund” for purposes section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D hold certain investments through, or in parallel with, special purpose holding companies or alternative investment vehicles organized to address tax, regulatory or structural considerations in connection with certain transactions.   Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D make co-investments in portfolio companies alongside other private equity funds that are not managed by the registrant or one of its controlled affiliates. In most cases, the lead sponsor of the buyout transaction will structure the co-investment such that the private fund invests via a dedicated co-investment vehicle controlled by the lead sponsor. Additionally, certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D that invest in other private equity funds or venture funds will receive from time to time distributions of marketable securities from the underlying fund, which securities are later sold on the open market. For purposes of Form ADV, the registrant classifies all such private funds as a fund-of-funds regardless of the amount of their exposure to direct investments.     Certain separate account clients are structured as a “fund of one” but are not reported as a “pooled investment vehicle” for purposes of Form ADV Part 1.   For purposes of Item 5, such clients are categorized by the type that is applicable to the client’s underlying investor; however, for purposes of Item 9, such clients are subject to an annual audit by an independent public accountant and such audited financials are distributed to the investor. With respect to Item 27 of Section 7.B.(1), as a manager of private equity fund-of-funds, the registrant relies heavily on the valuations provided by the underlying private investment fund managers. The registrant conducts independent due diligence to gain comfort with the values provided and the assumptions and conditions used to generate the fair market values of the underlying private investment fund’s asset and liabilities. The registrant has the ability to make fair market value adjustments, but it has only done so very limited circumstances since inception.  Certain non-U.S. separate account clients maintain bank accounts over which the registrant shares control.  Such bank accounts have overdraft facilities if the account becomes overdrawn.  The registrant does not deem any drawings on such facilities as borrowings for purposes of item 5.K of Form ADV Part 1A.  With respect to the registrant’s regulatory assets under management and gross asset values that consist of interests in underlying private investment funds or vehicles managed by third-party investment managers, the fair market value of such interests as of December 31, 2023 is based on the latest available valuations of such interests as provided by such third-party investment managers as of September 30, 2023, plus the net cash flows (i.e., capital calls and distributions) since such date, up to and including December 31, 2023.  All non-USD based cash flows and fair market values have been converted from the actual relevant currency to USD using foreign-exchange rates as of December 31, 2023.   The registrant and Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. each provide advisory services with respect to a certain private fund (and the manager thereof) within Carlyle’s Global Investment Solutions business segment. Each of the registrant and Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. has included the approximately $72 million related to such fund within such adviser’s respective total regulatory assets under management.  In addition to registrations with foreign financial regulatory authorities disclosed in this Form ADV, the registrant has sought authorization to market certain private fund clients in various non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to applicable private placement or similar regimes. The registrant and certain of its related persons are currently relying on CFTC No-Action Letter No 12-38 relief from the registration requirement for commodity pool operators of fund-of-funds that otherwise may have to register (or rely on another exemption from registration) as a result of their indirect exposure to commodity interests.   The registrant currently does not have a chief executive officer; however, the responsibilities of this position are primarily carried out by the head of Carlyle’s Global Investment Solutions business segment."

PRIOR TO THIS 2020 ANNUAL AMENDMENT, EACH ENTITY AND INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS ISSUED AN INVOICE FOR THE REGISTRANT’S ADVISORY SERVICES WAS COUNTED AS A DISTINCT “CLIENT” OR “BENEFICIAL OWNER” FOR PURPOSES OF THIS FORM. “CLIENTS” AND “BENEFICIAL OWNERS” ARE COUNTED BASED ON FAMILIAL AFFILIATION.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Fund GPs are special purpose entities and not relying advisers, as such terms are described in such letter.  Items 5.F(2) and 9.B(2): Certain funds may make investments through alternative investment vehicles (""AIVs"") or special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) that AIP forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory, or other structuring reasons such as AIPCF V Feeder A, LP, AIPCF V AIV A, LP, AIPCF VI Credit Opportunity Holding LP, AIPCF VI Smart Holding LP, AIPCF VI Smart Direct Investor AIV LP, AIPCF VI Stone AIV LP, AIP Stone Holding, LP, AIPCF VII BG Holdings, LP, AIPCF VII Credit Opportunity Holding LP, AIPCF VII Credit Opportunity Holding II LP, AIPCF VII Stone AIV, LP, AIP Stone II Holding, LP, AIPCF VII Strike Holdings, LP, AIPCF VII TA Holdings, LP, AIPCF VIII Credit Opportunity Holding II LP, AIPCF VIII Credit Opportunity Holding LP. Other AIVs and SPVs have not been separately reported in Items 5.F(2) and 9 and have not been separately listed in Section 7.B of Schedule D but rather aggregated with the fund to which they relate.  Item 7.A: The general partners of AIVs and SPVs have not been separately listed in Section 7.A of Schedule D. The registrant will provide a list of such general partners upon request.  Section 7.B.(1)A., Item 10: Although American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VI, L.P., American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VII, L.P., and American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VIII, LP are ""private equity funds"" in the commonly understood sense of the term, for technical reasons, these entities meet the definition of a ""hedge fund"" for the purposes of Form PF, which categorization is therefore reflected on this Form ADV.  Items 8.H and 5.B(6): We state that zero firms or other persons solicit advisory clients on AIP's behalf. While this remains true, AIP may, from time to time, use a third party placement agent for investor referrals. The costs of the placement agent are borne entirely by AIP and its affiliates.  Schedule A: Stanley Edme does not have a middle name, so the letters ""NMN"" (no middle name) have been included as a placeholder.  AIP answered “yes” to Question 5.L.1 (b) because the adviser provides specific investment advice but does so in compliance with the requirements of the rule, meaning that it is fair and balanced.

1924886,"Item 1.F.  The registrant has listed the offices at which it has advisory personnel as of December 31, 2023 and has not listed an office in Minnesota where the registrant does not have such personnel. Item 1.L. Although accessible from registrant’s primary place of business, the registrant has listed the corporate headquarters of companies providing cloud-based storage for certain of its books and records where such books and records are not also stored at the registrant’s primary place of business.  Item 5.D.1. Our response to this item is in respect of clients that registrant advises as of the date hereof. Item 5.D.2.(j)  Registrant was not able to report a separately managed account client because no regulatory assets under management were attributable to such client as of December 31, 2023 (the date as of which regulatory assets under management are reported in Item 5).  As of the date of this filing, no regulatory assets under management are attributable to such client.  Item 5.D.3. The aggregate amount of regulatory assets under management reported in Item 5.D.3. includes regulatory assets under management attributable to a pooled investment vehicle that is a non-client proprietary account. Regulatory assets under management are reported as of December 31, 2023. See also note above. Item 5.F.  Our response to this item is in respect of applicable services registrant provides as of the date hereof.  To avoid double counting, feeder fund vehicles have been consolidated with the related master fund, and only one account per master-feeder structure where reported as a master-feeder arrangement for 7(B)(1) is counted.  Any co-investment vehicle that is not a client does not have its assets reflected in reported regulatory assets.  Series constituting separate “private funds” for purposes of Form ADV are not counted as separate accounts for this item.  The amount of regulatory assets under management and the corresponding accounts are reported as of December 31, 2023.   Assets of any client the investors of which are solely other clients are not double counted in regulatory assets under management, but such client is counted as an account.  Where such client is a non-United States person, only the assets of its investors who are non-United States persons will be counted for 5(F)(3).  Item 7.A.  Certain related persons of the registrant exercise control or investment discretion over family investment vehicles for which they receive no compensation. These vehicles are not listed on Item 7A of Schedule D.  Item 7.B.  The registrant has created, and from time to time may create, special purpose vehicles that are or may be utilized by its advisory clients, third party co-investors and a non-client proprietary account to implement portions of their investment strategies.  These are generally not listed as private funds.  The financial statements and investor account statements sent to investors in the registrant’s private funds that hold an interest in any SPV reflect all applicable information related to such SPVs, including such SPVs that are listed as private funds.   Similarly, this ADV reflects certain SPV information, such as custodians, as applicable to the registrant’s private funds. The registrant lists private fund clients it advises as of the date hereof.  For such funds, current gross asset value is regulatory assets under management for such fund or applicable master-feeder structure as of December 31, 2023, except for Monarch Co-Invest Fund – P LP for which the measurement date is October 15, 2024.  Beneficial ownership information is shown as of December 31, 2023. Any beneficial ownership percentages are shown on a net asset value basis. Beneficial ownership reported in respect of Monarch Capital Mater Partners II LP includes investors with rights to distributions. Custodian information is provided as of March 28, 2024, except for Monarch Co-Invest Fund – P LP, for which the custodian information is as of the date hereof, in all cases based on information available at the time of preparation of the relevant filing and is in respect of counterparties holding assets or funds as of such time.  Stated minimum investment amounts are subject to waiver and generally are waived under certain circumstances. The registrant may employ service providers or valuation specialists to value positions, but ultimately it is the registrant that decides the final valuation in accordance with its Valuation Policy.  Item 9.  Our response to this item is in respect of clients that registrant advises as of the date hereof.  To avoid double-counting, the aggregate assets attributable to a master-feeder structure reflect the assets of any underlying SPVs (e.g., the value of master fund assets invested in a special purpose vehicle are not counted twice).    Consistent with registrant’s response to Item 5F, assets of any client the investors of which are solely other clients are not double-counted for purposes of reporting assets for which the registrant has custody, however such client is counted as a client for which registrant has custody. The dollar amount of funds and securities shown is calculated in the same manner as regulatory assets under management except that uncalled capital commitments are excluded.  The dollar amount of funds and securities is for current clients, valued as of December 31, 2023.   As between the registrant and its related persons that act as general partner to certain of the registrant’s clients (each, a “GP”), assets (of a master-feeder structure where reporting as a master-feeder arrangement for 7(B)(1)) are attributed to the registrant except where a GP acts a general partner for the master fund of such master-feeder structure.  For attribution of client count, such master-feeder structures are not aggregated. Item 10.  Christopher Santana, Adam Sklar and Stacey Maman, each have indirect ownership that is not disclosed on Schedule B because it does not meet the reporting threshold."

1920651,"This note explains changes to Items 1, 3 and 4 and a succession by amendment to this registration. Earned Wealth Advisors, LLC is the successor to Capital Performance Advisors LLP d/b/a Thomas Doll Advisors. This was a company reorganization with no change in ownership, management, or control of the firm and the CRD number remains the same. Relatedly, Earned Wealth Advisors, LLC has received assignment of all client investment advisory agreements from its affiliate, NoHo Financial, Inc. d/b/a Earned Wealth, another SEC registered investment advisor with CRD number 316933. The information in this ADV reflects assignment of that business to Earned Wealth Advisors, LLC. NoHo Financial, Inc. will soon file an ADV-W. These changes integrate the investment advisor businesses of the parent, Earned Wealth Operating Company, with no impact to the ownership or management of the Firm. ---------- Custody reported under Item 9 consists of standing letters of authorization permitting transfers to accounts that custodians characterize as third party, including where a custodian characterizes as third party even when the client is a beneficial owner of the destination account.

1920798,"AT THE TIME OF REGISTRANT'S INITIAL FILING OF FORM ADV THE ONLY PHYSICAL OFFICE OF REGISTRANT AND ITS AFFILIATES WAS IN TORONTO, ONTARIO, CANADA, EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE A NUMBER OF U.S. AFFILIATED LEGAL ENTITIES.  AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH SEC STAFF, IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT REGISTRANT WAS THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO BECOME REGISTERED UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT.

1922920,"In regards to 19 of the 23 private funds reported under 7.B.1-Private Fund Reporting, we have answered yes to 6(c) and have also answered yes to 8(a), as it was determined this was the most appropriate way to disclose the fund structure, where each of the private funds sole purpose is to invest substantially all assets in an externally managed ""master"" fund, which is named in 6.(d) for each of these funds."
1922381,"For Schedule D, Section 1.F, there are certain locations where Global Infrastructure Management, LLC and its affiliates (“GIM”) operate its business without physical addresses or dedicated space including (i) Singapore and (ii) Dallas, Texas. In addition, GIM maintains a liaison office in Seoul, Korea, and certain private funds maintain a Luxembourg office for regulatory local presence requirements. GIM can provide additional information regarding these locations upon request. For Item 5, regulatory assets under management reflect the gross aggregate value of the assets held by private funds and separately managed accounts as of year-end plus unfunded capital commitments. GIM forms special purpose vehicles to serve as the general partners or managing members of certain private funds managed by GIM and are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC letter addressed to the American Bar Association’s Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities dated October 8, 2005, as updated on January 18, 2012. From time to time, certain private funds and separately managed accounts make investments through alternative investment vehicles and holding companies (collectively “AIVs”) that GIM forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory, or other structuring reasons. The AIVs have not been separately reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), but information regarding the AIVs has been aggregated with the private funds or separately managed accounts to which they relate. Regulatory assets under management and gross asset values are estimated and unaudited and may differ materially from the final audited amounts. Certain entities recently formed or being wound down with gross asset values of zero or near zero as of year-end are not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1). However, committed capital that has not been called by certain such recently formed entities is included in the amount of regulatory assets under management in Item 5 and the information provided in Item 9. In addition, these entities are included the number of clients managed by GIM. Where applicable, regulatory assets under management and gross asset values have been converted from EURO, INR, GBP, and AUD to USD based on the 12/31/2023 Spot Rate. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), the total commitment amount for each private fund was used to calculate the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), a private fund’s general partner (or similar managing entity) is not counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13, and the general partner’s commitment amount is excluded when calculating the percentages for the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), where applicable, investors in a private fund who have made capital commitments but have not yet had capital called are counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), due to the structural overlap of certain private funds, separately managed accounts, and co-investment clients, GIM answered in the negative for Question 19 and indicated zero percent for Question 20 as it believes that such structural overlap does not constitute a solicitation of any such client or investment by any such client into a private fund. For purposes of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), in response to Question 28, GIM indicated “Yes” for private funds that are currently in an active fundraising period utilizing a third-party placement agent, and “No” for private funds that previously employed a third-party placement agent but whose fundraising period has ended. Global Infrastructure Partners Singapore Manager Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIM, is not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.A. This entity is a sub-manager to certain non-US private funds and separately managed accounts and receives management fees from such entities, but does not conduct any investment advisory services. GIP IV Cavalry Co-Invest II, L.P. is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). This entity is an investment-specific vehicle whose sole beneficial owner is Infra Investors II Co-Invest, L.P., a private fund listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). Global Infrastructure Partners IV-C / C2 AIV, L.P. was formed for investment structuring purposes and is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). However, its beneficial owners are investors in other Global Infrastructure Partners IV private funds, which are listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). For purposes of Item 8.A.(1), from time to time, GIM warehouses investments for certain private funds that have not been formed or have not closed when the investments are made. Once formed, GIM transfers the investments to the respective private funds pursuant to their governing documents.  GIM discloses these warehousing arrangements and the corresponding risks to prospective investors within the relevant private placement memoranda. For purposes of Item 8.A.(2), certain of GIM’s principals and employees invest in the same investments as the private funds (including co-investments) through such funds’ general partner entities or dedicated “friends and family” vehicles. Certain private funds and separately managed accounts hold public securities indirectly at Caixa Bank. For Schedule D, Section 1.L., certain service providers that maintain GIM’s books and records have cloud-based storage. The books and records can be accessed from the GIM offices. GIM does not disclose the exact addresses and information of our books and records service providers and/or cloud-based storage providers for cybersecurity reasons. Conventional rounding methods were used to report the percentages when required to provide a percentage, as decimal amounts cannot be entered."

1930506,"Further to item 3.A of Form ADV Part 1A, the registrant is a private company limited by shares (besloten vennootschap) organized under the laws of the Netherlands and is based in Amsterdam. Its form of organization is similar to that of a corporation in the United States. The registrant is also licensed with the Netherlands Authority of Financial Markets as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager under the European Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive (“AIFMD”). Certain investment vehicles managed by the registrant are “Alternative Investment Funds” within the meaning of AIFMD.  Advisory clients of the registrant include private funds, other pooled investment vehicles, and separately managed accounts for large institutional investors.  The registrant shares investment staff with certain US and non-US affiliated entities, and the registrant has included all such personnel in its responses to Item 5.A and Item 5.B. Certain advisory clients are structured as a fund established for a single investor or a group of affiliated investors and for purposes of Form ADV Part 1A are treated (i) as a pooled investment vehicle and (ii) as a private fund only to the extent it relies on either of the exemptions provided by 3(c)1 or 3(c)7 of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.  Certain of these private fund advisory clients were established for non-U.S. third-party investors that have expressly requested that the advisory client prepare annual audited financial statements in accordance with accounting principles other than U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (e.g., International Financial Reporting Standards). Additionally, the registrant has established and manages multiple investment vehicles per the terms of the respective investment management agreements with the registrant’s prior owners, APG Asset Management N.V. and PGGM Vermogensbeheer B.V. For purposes of Item 5 of Form ADV Part 1A, these investment vehicles are not treated as pooled investment vehicles, rather each advisory client is treated as a separately managed account.  Certain advisory clients have the right to opt-out of certain investment opportunities under certain circumstances. Notwithstanding any such opt-out rights, the registrant classifies such client accounts as discretionary. Related persons of the registrant who serve as general partners, commodity pool operators or managers of pooled investment vehicles or as other investment advisers that are not listed on section 7.A. of this Schedule D are listed on the Form ADV of one or more of the following affiliated investment advisers that are separately registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): (i)AlpInvest US Holdings, LLC (SEC File no. 801-129132); (ii) AlpInvest Private Equity Investment Management, LLC (SEC file no. 801-126208); (iii) Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-50462); and (iv) Carlyle Global Credit Investment Management L.L.C. (SEC File no. 801-77691).  The minimum investment commitment indicated for any private fund may be reduced in the discretion of the applicable general partner or the registrant.  Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have limited partners which are themselves pooled investment vehicles established and controlled by a third-party not affiliated with the registrant.  While any such vehicle may have invested all, or substantially all, of its assets into the private fund, the registrant deems such vehicles to be a “fund-of-funds” rather than a “feeder fund” for purposes section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D hold certain investments through, or in parallel with, special purpose holding companies or alternative investment vehicles organized to address tax, regulatory or structural considerations in connection with certain transactions.   Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D make co-investments in portfolio companies alongside other private equity funds that are not managed by the registrant or one of its controlled affiliates. In most cases, the lead sponsor of the buyout transaction will structure the co-investment such that the private fund invests via a dedicated co-investment vehicle controlled by the lead sponsor. Additionally, certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D that invest in other private equity funds or venture funds will receive from time to time distributions of marketable securities from the underlying fund, which securities are later sold on the open market. For purposes of Form ADV, the registrant classifies all such private funds as a fund-of-funds regardless of the amount of their exposure to direct investments.  Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) – AMC 2012 Ltd., AMC 2013 Ltd., AMC 2014 Ltd. and AMC 2015 Ltd. – are feeder vehicles organized outside the United States and established solely for the purpose of allowing certain senior investment professionals of the registrant and its affiliates to co-invest in special purpose non-U.S. investment vehicles established in respect of a single non-U.S. advisory client’s managed account as required under the investment management agreement with such advisory client (which came into effect prior to the registrant’s registration with the SEC as an investment adviser). Such non-U.S. investment vehicles are subject to an annual review by the registrant’s independent accounting firm in accordance with the agreement with the advisory client.  Further, the registrant manages other pooled investment vehicles that (i) are organized outside of the United States and (ii) do not have any direct third-party investors that are U.S. persons.  The financial statements of such pooled investments vehicles are audited (if at all) in accordance with the terms of the agreements governing such investment vehicles, and such financial statements may not be prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.   Certain separate account clients are structured as a “fund of one” but are not reported as a “pooled investment vehicle” for purposes of Form ADV Part 1.   For purposes of Item 5, such clients are categorized by the type that is applicable to the client’s underlying investor; however, for purposes of Item 9, such clients are subject to an annual audit by an independent public accountant and such audited financials are distributed to the investor. With respect to Item 27 of Section 7.B.(1), as a manager of private equity fund-of-funds, the registrant relies heavily on the valuations provided by the underlying private investment fund managers. The registrant conducts independent due diligence to gain comfort with the values provided and the assumptions and conditions used to generate the fair market values of the underlying private investment fund’s asset and liabilities. The registrant has the ability to make fair market value adjustments, but it has only done so very limited circumstances since inception.  Certain non-U.S. separate account clients maintain bank accounts over which the registrant shares control.  Such bank accounts have overdraft facilities if the account becomes overdrawn.  The registrant does not deem any drawings on such facilities as borrowings for purposes of item 5.K of Form ADV Part 1A.  With respect to the registrant’s regulatory assets under management and gross asset values that consist of interests in underlying private investment funds or vehicles managed by third-party investment managers, the fair market value of such interests as of December 31, 2023 is based on the latest available valuations of such interests as provided by such third-party investment managers as of September 30, 2023, plus the net cash flows (i.e., capital calls and distributions) since such date, up to and including December 31, 2023.  All non-USD based cash flows and fair market values have been converted from the actual relevant currency to USD using foreign-exchange rates as of December 31, 2023.   In addition to registrations with foreign financial regulatory authorities disclosed in this Form ADV, the registrant has sought authorization to market certain private fund clients in various non-U.S. jurisdictions pursuant to applicable private placement or similar regimes. The registrant and certain of its related persons are currently relying on CFTC No-Action Letter No 12-38 relief from the registration requirement for commodity pool operators of fund-of-funds that otherwise may have to register (or rely on another exemption from registration) as a result of their indirect exposure to commodity interests in respect of its U.S. advisory clients and other advisory clients with U.S. investors.   The registrant currently does not have a chief executive officer; however, the responsibilities of this position are primarily carried out by the head of Carlyle’s Global Investment Solutions business segment."

1920814,"This amended Form ADV reflects updates to Hall Capital’s direct and indirect owners on Schedules A and B following a transaction completed on December 2, 2024, in which Pathstone Family Office, LLC (“Pathstone”) acquired Hall Capital. Until the time that operations are fully integrated, legacy Hall Capital personnel will continue to provide services to Hall Capital advisory clients as described in Hall Capital’s Form ADV Part 2A Brochure. Changes in personnel titles and roles following the acquisition are not reflected in Schedule A of this amendment. Once Hall Capital’s operations are fully integrated into Pathstone, which is expected to be completed during 2025, Hall Capital intends to withdraw its registration from the SEC. Please refer to the Form ADV for Pathstone Family Office, LLC (CRD # 151736) for information regarding Hall Capital’s new parent company.  ITEMS 5.D. and 5.F.: A single client advisory relationship may encompass a group of related individuals or entities. In addition, Hall Capital has discretionary authority over some, but not all, of the assets in particular client advisory relationships. For purposes of reporting all values in Item 5.D and the Total Number of Accounts in Item 5.F, we categorized each client relationship based on the categorization of the majority of the asset values within such relationship. The values reported for Discretionary and Non-Discretionary regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) in Item 5.F are based on the individual categorization of each asset. ITEMS 5.D., 5.F., 9.A., and 9.B. and SCH. D, SECTIONS 5.K.(1) and 7.B.(1): Certain Customized Global Multi-Asset Class and Specialized Mandates (“CGMA”) clients are also invested in private funds that we manage (“HCP Pooled Vehicles”). To avoid double counting, such CGMA client investments are reported solely in the RAUM attributable to HCP Pooled Vehicles.  Pursuant to Form ADV General Instructions Item 5 for private fund reporting, we treat all assets of (and uncalled capital commitments to) an HCP Pooled Vehicle as a securities portfolio when reporting the RAUM for such HCP Pooled Vehicle. Where an HCP Pooled Vehicle invests in another HCP Pooled Vehicle, the amounts attributable to such investment are considered assets of each respective private fund and therefore reported twice in our RAUM.  Certain of the HCP Pooled Vehicles are organized as master-feeder fund structures. Pursuant to Form ADV General Instructions Item 7 for private fund reporting, we report each master-feeder arrangement as a single Section 7.B.(1) private fund and identify our feeder funds under the name of the following master funds: HCP Absolute Return Fund Master Feeder, LLC; HCP China PE 2009, L.P.; HCP Full Consequence Investing Fund I, L.P.; HCP Full Consequence Investing Fund II, L.P.; HCP Private Equity Fund III, L.P.; HCP Private Equity Fund IV, L.P.; HCP Private Equity Fund V, L.P.; HCP Private Equity Fund VI, L.P.; HCP Private Equity Fund VII, L.P.; and HCP Special Opportunities Master Fund, LLC. Alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) are created as structuring vehicles for particular investments made by certain private funds listed in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D to address various tax or other similar concerns that do not engage in investment-related activity separate and apart from the advisory activities provided by the Registrant. AIVs have not been separately reported on this Form ADV, and information regarding each AIV has been aggregated with the private fund to which it relates. In Item 11 of Section 7.B.(1), we report gross asset value as of 9/30/2023 for funds containing significant illiquid holdings and as of 12/31/2023 for other funds. These approaches also apply to the reporting in Items 9.A. and 9.B.    SCH D., SECTION 5.K.(2)(A): Consistent with registrant's categorization of assets for purposes of Section 5.K.(1), registrant does not report in Section 5.K.(2) underlying exposures to borrowings and derivatives that may exist in asset category 12: Other - Separately managed accounts managed by other investment advisers. SCH D., SECTION 5.K.(3)(G): This response does not include the amount of RAUM held at the custodian attributable to separately managed accounts managed by other investments advisers.  ITEM 7.A. and SCH. D, SECTION 7.A.: Galvanize Climate Solutions LLC (“GCS”) and its Relying Advisers, Galvanize Climate Solutions UK LLP; Galvanize Innovation & Expansion Manager, LP; Galvanize Ponderosa Manager, LP; and Galvanize Real Estate Manager, LP (collectively, the “GCS Relying Advisers”), are reported as Related Persons because they are under common control with Registrant through Kathryn A. Hall. However, GCS and GCS Relying Advisers operate independently from Hall Capital. See also Item 10 of Registrant’s Form ADV Part 2A.  ITEMS 7.B. and 8.B.(2), SCH. A, SCH. B, and SCH. D, SECTIONS 7.A. and 7.B.:  Hall Capital seeks to leverage the experience and resources of the business leaders, investors, entrepreneurs, philanthropists, and other professionals in its network to identify attractive investment opportunities for its clients. This network includes Hall Capital clients, outside members, directors, and persons or entities with which Hall Capital has a relationship (“Benefited Persons”). Where deemed appropriate, Hall Capital selects or recommends for investment by clients certain underlying managers (“Benefited Investment Advisers”) and underlying funds (“Benefited Investment Funds”) with respect to which Benefited Persons (or their related persons) are control persons or in which such persons have a financial interest. Benefited Investment Funds include the Farallon Funds, H&F Funds, HMI Capital Partners, and the Prime Residential Funds. In addition, from time to time, professionals such as underlying managers, accountants, tax specialists have in the past and may in the future introduce people to Hall Capital who ultimately become clients of the firm. Hall Capital does not compensate these parties for such introductions. Management fees and/or incentive compensation that a client pays to a Benefited Investment Adviser or Benefited Investment Fund confer a benefit on the applicable Benefited Person, which creates an incentive for Hall Capital to select or recommend such underlying manager or underlying fund for investment by clients. The incentives created by these relationships potentially conflict with the firm’s duty to treat each client equitably and make recommendations that are in each client’s best interest. Hall Capital discloses the existence of an association with Benefited Investment Advisers and Benefited Investment Funds when it recommends such investments to its clients. See also Items 10 and 11 of Registrant’s Form ADV Part 2A.  ITEM 8.A.(1): Although Registrant’s policy does not prohibit principal transactions, Registrant generally does not engage in any principal transactions.     ITEM 8.A.(2): Registrant is not obligated to acquire for any account any security that Registrant or its employees may acquire for its or their own accounts or for the account of any other client, if in the absolute discretion of Registrant, it is not practical or desirable to acquire a position in such security for that account.  SCH. R: KHALL LLC is a Relying Adviser of Registrant. Registrant and the Relying Adviser are together filing a single Form ADV Part 1A.

1928539,"Items 1B and 7.A: Ecosystem Investment Partners, LLC (EIP) has established special purpose vehicles (each an “SPV”) to act as the general partners of its private funds. The SPVs have not registered with the Commission in reliance on the positions expressed in the ABA No-Action Letters dated December 8, 2005 and January 18, 2012. EIP is not filing a Schedule R for each general partner and is instead including disclosure here, pursuant to an SEC Staff response to a Form ADV, Frequently Asked Question posted June 2017, guiding registrants that a Schedule R is not required. On Schedule D, Sections 1.B. and 7.A., EIP has omitted (i) the general partners of its private fund general partners (ultimate general partners) which were formed for structuring or liability purposes, (ii) certain special purpose entities owned by the funds that were formed for tax reasons and (iii) other mostly disregarded entities associated with the investment adviser. A full list of omitted entities will be provided to the SEC upon request. // Item 1.F.: The response to this item includes all offices at which EIP conducts investment advisory business. Office locations of affiliated entities are not included in this response as investment advisory business is not conducted at such locations (e.g., office space for affiliate project manager).// Item 5.A.: EIP employed 18 individuals as of EIP’s most recent annual update filed March 27, 2024. Employees of affiliated entities are  not counted as EIP employees under Item 5.A., as such individuals are not EIP Supervised Persons providing investment advice on EIP’s behalf. The instructions to Form ADV, Part 1A define a Supervised Person as including “any of your officers, partners, directors (or other persons occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), or employees, or other person who provides investment advice on your behalf and is subject to your supervision or control.” // Items 5.F., 7.B., and 9: Regulatory assets under management (RAUM) reported in Item 5.F.  and custody assets reported in Items 9.A.2.(a) and 9.B.2.(a) do not include duplicate assets in situations where a fund invests in another fund managed by EIP. The gross assets of each fund reported in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D reflects RAUM without such deduction. RAUM reported herein is as of December 31, 2023, and is based upon audited financial statements for funds under management as of December 31, 2023. Responses provided for Items 5.F. and 7.B., with respect to the number of clients and accounts, is as of March 27, 2024, the date of EIP’s Form ADV annual filing. Specifically, the Form ADV, Part 1A reflects Ecosystem Investment Partners V, LP (Fund V) as a new client/account and the RAUM figures in Items 5.F. and 7.B. do not include Fund V as this fund’s initial closing was not held until late March 2024. Further, we responded for Section 8.B.(1)B.23.(g) that Fund V’s audited financial statements were not distributed to private fund investors and for Section 8.B.(1)B.23.(h) that the reports were not yet received as the requirement to obtain a financial audit is not yet due for this new fund. EIP is deemed to have custody of private fund client assets because EIP and its related persons serve as the general partners of the funds. Items 9.A.(2)(a) and 9.B.(2)(a)  exclude uncalled capital that is included in Item 5.F. RAUM and the responses to Section 7.B. The number of clients for which these related persons are deemed to have custody are included in Items 9.A. (2) (b) and 9.B. (2)(b) as of March 27, 2024. // Item 6.B.(3): EIP is a private fund investment adviser established to make investments in large-scale ecological restoration and conservation projects. These projects meet a large and growing demand for environmental offsets that mitigate impacts to wetlands, streams and other important natural resources stemming from infrastructure, commercial, industrial and residential development. EIP’s primary investment focus is on mitigation for unavoidable and permitted impacts required by the federal Clean Water Act of 1972 (“Clean Water Act”) and Endangered Species Act of 1973 (“Endangered Species Act”). EIP’s differentiated approach involves the acquisition, entitlement, restoration, sustainable management and, ultimately, divestiture of properties that generate revenues through the sale of wetland, stream, endangered species and other environmental credits to entities seeking compliance under the aforementioned regulations. Additionally, EIP selectively undertakes investments that deliver regionally significant restoration projects through pay-for-success contracts whereby EIP finances, designs and constructs large-scale projects, receiving fixed payments, or performance-based revenues, as ecological success milestones are achieved. EIP forms private funds to invest in these opportunities. Current income generated by the sale of mitigation credits and other fully-contracted pay-for-success contracts is expected to represent most of the total return for the private funds with the remainder of the private funds’ total return expected to be driven by property divestment. // Schedule A: Managing Partners are listed as having control in Schedule A. While the definition of “Control” in the Form ADV instructions presume that “each of your firm’s officers…executing executive responsibility…is presumed to control the firm,” as indicated in our Schedule A, EIP has determined that EIP’s Managing Partners are deemed to have control of EIP."

Martello Re Limited, a reinsurance vehicle formed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”), commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2021; Centerbridge Martello Advisors, L.L.C. and Barings LLC (which is affiliated with MassMutual but not with the Registrant) both provide investment advisory services in a joint-venture arrangement. In the case of the Martello Re structure, assets from SC IV, CB Martello Feeder, L.P., CB Martello SBS, L.P., BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC – Martello Re Series and BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust – Martello Re Sub-Trust also are reflected in the RAUM attributed to insurance company clients in light of the different nature of the advisory mandates and distinct associated advisory fees payable to the applicable advisers For purposes of Section 5.K.(1) of Schedule D, Centerbridge is including in the breakdown of asset types for Martello Re those assets custodied by Centerbridge. CB LDV Co-Invest, L.P. - Series A, CP Argo Marina Holdings, L.P. and Centerbridge Capital Partners V - N Co-Invest, L.P. received commitments, and commenced or will commence operations as private funds, after 12/31/2023, thus for all the gross asset value reported in response to question 11 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 is zero. The assets under management calculation, as expressed in ADV Part 2A, applies a different methodology that results in a figure different from regulatory assets under management.  |  The 12/ 17/2020 Amendment to this Form ADV included changes to reflect the retirement of Mark Gallogly in December 2020. In the case of certain entities, ownership (including capital) of limited partnership interests results in “Control Person” status in certain sections of Schedule R. The Registrant notes that as it relates to disclosures in Schedule A, Vivek Melwani does not have a middle name or middle initial.  |  With respect to Item 6, the Registrant may from time to time have its employees or other representatives on the boards of directors and/or other committees, or acting in management roles, of certain companies in which one or more private funds are invested.  |  With respect to the questions regarding the Registrant’s related persons in Item 7, certain companies owned by Registrant’s related persons are, or may become, during the course of the related person’s investment, involved in financial services and/or investment advisory activities, which may include status as broker-dealers, investment companies or other pooled investment vehicles or investment advisers, among other things. The Registrant formed collateralized bond obligation (CBO) vehicles Centerbridge Credit Funding 1, Ltd. and Centerbridge Credit Funding II, Ltd. and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) vehicles Park Blue CLO 2022-I, Ltd., Park Blue CLO 2022-II, Ltd., Park Blue CLO 2023-III, Ltd. and Park Blue CLO 2023-IV, Ltd. (“CLO IV”) (the aforementioned CBO and CLO vehicles, collectively, the “CDO Vehicles”). As of Registrant’s last Form ADV annual filing, SC IV owned equity in CLO IV and Centerbridge Special Credit III-Flex, L.P. owned equity in the other CDO Vehicles. Centerbridge Credit Funding Advisors, LLC, which is identified in this Form ADV as a relying adviser of the Registrant, provides advisory services to the CDO Vehicles, and may in the future provide advisory services to other vehicles that are similar in nature.  |  Responses to question 13 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 include where applicable investors who have made capital commitments that have not had capital called.

In the case of Centerbridge Capital Partners, L.P. and Centerbridge Capital Partners Strategic, L.P., which are in late harvest, Registrant has provisionally responded with zero percent to question 14 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1. to reflect that, while the General Partner has a capital interest in each, there may at the time of ultimate disposition of such private funds’ remaining assets and completion of waterfall calculations be required a return of a portion of carried interest previously distributed.  The responses in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 pertaining to BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series and BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust are provided in reliance on information provided by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., which Registrant has not itself independently verified. Per Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA); however, the trust’s sub-trusts, including Martello Re Sub-Trust, are not separately registered with CIMA, therefore the Registrant has not listed CIMA in the response to question 5 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1. for BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust.  |  The Registrant is affiliated with Overland Advisors, LLC, with which the Registrant has a relationship, including the provision of resources pursuant to a resource sharing agreement. Overland Advisors, LLC has been formed to provide investment advice to a business development company and is a separate investment adviser with its own Form ADV filing (https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/325525).   |  The 8/23/2024 Amendment to this Form ADV was filed in part for the purpose of generating private fund identification numbers (“PF IDs”), as required for Form PF, for (i) CB LDV Co-Invest, L.P. - Series B and (ii) Overland Advantage Feeder Fund, L.P., both of which are reporting certain data as of 6/30/2024.

Coatue Cardinal Main Fund LP and the Opportunity Funds will be audited, however, the first audit will not be until the end of 2024 and accordingly, Coatue Management has indicated that the audited financial statements have not yet been received for such funds.  Coatue Management has responded “no” for Item 8.A.1. due to the fact that it does not engage in principal transactions in the ordinary course of its business, however, from time to time (particularly in connection with the funding of certain investments in private companies due to the expedited timing of funding such transactions), Coatue Management has previously in limited circumstances and expects in the future that it may enter into a principal transaction with a Client.  Certain funds advised by Coatue Management have registered in various foreign jurisdictions solely for the purpose of marketing such funds in the relevant jurisdiction.

1933973,"To further clarify Item 1.I., our Firm, Nordea Investment Management North America, Inc. (“NIMNAI”), does not have its own website. It should be noted that our ultimate parent company bank does have one, www.nordea.com, which captures general information as it relates to its asset management capabilities. Additionally, Nordea Asset Management Holding AB, a Swedish domiciled company and parent to Nordea Investment Management AB (NIMNAI’s parent) has launched a website, www.nordeaassetmanagement.com, which contains additional information regarding asset management capabilities. In regards to 1.K., it should be noted that NIMNAI’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and President is expected to devote approximately 50% of his full business time to NIMNAI business and approximately 50% of his full business time continuing to serve as General Counsel of the New York Branch of Nordea Bank Abp, NIMNAI’s ultimate parent company bank (and, in that capacity, will continue to provide legal services to NIMNAI’s U.S. broker-dealer affiliate).  This service provided to NIMNAI’s affiliates by NIMNAI’s CEO and President may create potential conflicts of interests.  The Nordea Group has policies, procedures, and governance committees in place to mitigate these potential risks.  In addition, NIMNAI’s CEO and President may, in his capacity as General Counsel for NIMNAI’s affiliate, receive access to information that is not permitted to be shared with NIMNAI or NIM AB, even if such information could benefit NIMNAI, NIM AB or their clients, and consequently neither NIMNAI, NIM AB nor their clients will receive the benefit of such information. In response to Items 5.A. and 5.B(1), as of December 31, 2023 we have 3.5 direct employees and 2 of these employees perform investment advisory functions. NIMNAI has introduced an option for permanent remote working for certain employees with additional Compliance oversight. We have a non-U.S. participating affiliates, Nordea Investment Management AB (""NIM AB""), who is involved in the operation and investment advisory functions of our business. Pursuant to the Unibanco line of SEC no-action letters, NIM AB does not have direct relationships with our clients and all of our clients are treated as solely clients of our business, and not clients of our participating affiliates’ businesses. The personnel of NIM AB are subject to our supervision and all compliance requirements to which our employees are subject, and are also subject to the regulatory authority of the SEC. The number of employees of our participating affiliates who perform advisory functions for our advisory clients is 94 as of February 29, 2024. The Unibanco letters include: Uniao de Bancos de Brasileiros, SEC No-Action Letter (pub. avail. July 28, 1992); The National Mutual Group, SEC No-Action Letter (pub. avail.

Pursuant to IM Information Update IM-INFO-2017-03, NIM AB and NIMNAI have provided the SEC with the documentation and representations required to rely on the Unibanco Letters prior to the submission of this filing. As a participating affiliate without a place of business in the United States, NIM AB must designate a United States-domiciled agent for service of process and it has appointed NIMNAI to serve in such capacity for disputes arising out of NIM AB’s participation in the advisory business of NIMNAI in the United States. Item 5.I. NIMNAI does not currently serve as a portfolio manager to wrap fee programs. However, NIMNAI has served as a portfolio manager to various wrap fee programs in the past and maintains the ability to serve in this capacity in the future. Schedule D Section 7.A. The ultimate parent company bank of NIMNAI, Nordea Bank Abp, operates numerous subsidiaries in the various countries in which it operates. Some of these subsidiaries may operate as investment advisory companies and broker-dealers. Additionally, the subsidiaries operate in numerous functions as part of a diversified financial services company. However, NIMNAI does not have any other advisory affiliates  within the United States that provide investment advice to clients within the United States. A full organizational chart is available upon request. Furthermore, portfolio managers who perform investment advisory services for NIMNAI are employed by the Parent of NIMNAI. A listing of these portfolio managers is available by product upon request. Item 8.F. Other subsidiaries of Nordea Bank ABP or NIM AB may compensate others for client referrals. The aforementioned other subsidiaries do not compensate any person for referrals to NIMNAI. Our clients maintain direct custodial relationships with qualified custodians.

1925258,"Oaktree’s asset management business is indirectly controlled by Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC (“BOH”) (formerly known as Oaktree Capital Group, LLC) and Oaktree Capital Holdings, LLC (“OCH”) (formerly known as Atlas OCM Holdings, LLC).  A majority of Oaktree’s business is owned by Brookfield Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (collectively, “Brookfield”) and the remainder is owned by current and former Oaktree executives and employees, and certain related individuals and entities.  Brookfield’s ownership interest in Oaktree’s business is held through BOH, OCH and related entities.  Brookfield and Oaktree operate their respective investment businesses largely independently, with each operating under its own brand and led by its existing management and investment teams, and Oaktree and Brookfield generally managing their investment operations independently of each other subject to an information barrier between the firms.  Oaktree does not consider Brookfield or its affiliates to be its “advisory affiliates” or “related persons” for purposes of this Form ADV.  For more information regarding Brookfield and its affiliates, please refer to the Form ADV of Brookfield affiliated investment advisers: Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC (CRD# 110497), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Canada, LP (CRD# 151605), Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Credit), LLC (CRD# 170811), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Adviser (Private Equity), L.P.

(CRD# 312797), Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Advisor LLC (CRD# 312792), and Brookfield Renewable Energy Group LLC (CRD# 316590).  Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. (“OCGH”) holds 100% of the Class B units of OCH which, during the period (the “Initial Period”, which is more specifically described in the Form 8-K filed October 4, 2019, available through EDGAR) from September 30, 2019 through , the date on which Brookfield delivers a written election to end the Initial Period (which election cannot be delivered before September 30, 2026 unless certain events occur before then), entitle OCGH to 10 votes per Class B unit on all matters to be submitted to a vote of the OCH members. In addition, during the Initial Period, the board of directors of Atlas OCM is comprised of two individuals selected by OCGH, two selected by Brookfield, and the remaining directors nominated by OCGH and subject to joint written appointment by each of OCGH and Brookfield.  As a result, during the Initial Period, OCGH will maintain actual control of Atlas OCM and, indirectly, the Registrant, although Atlas OCM is permitted to take certain actions without the consent of Brookfield.  The General Partner of the Limited Partnerships listed in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has the authority to waive the minimum investment requirement. Some of the Limited Partnerships for which the Registrant acts as General Partner or Investment Adviser are closed-end limited partnerships. As such, clients are not solicited to invest in such closed-end limited partnerships after the final closing has occurred. We have excluded from our disclosure limited partnerships and/or limited liability companies organized and operated solely for the benefit of our employees as well as any special purpose vehicles that were formed in relation to a specific investment or private fund.  For certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) of schedule D that are denominated in Euro, the Gross Asset Value and minimum investment commitment values have been converted to USD for purposes of reporting.  For all private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value has been rounded to the nearest thousands.  For purposes of Item 5: Information About Your Advisory Business – Regulatory Assets Under Management, Oaktree advises certain funds of funds that invest solely in other private funds advised by Oaktree, as noted in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. for purposes of calculating Regulatory Assets Under Management as reported in Item 5 and reporting of the Gross Asset Value of private funds in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the limited partner interests held in the other Oaktree private funds by the funds of funds have been excluded from the Gross Asset Values of such funds of funds.  As such, the Gross Asset Value of such funds of funds may be reported as zero in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), if such funds of funds have no other assets other than the limited partner interests in the other Oaktree private funds. In addition, feeder funds are consolidated with the main fund to which they relate for purposes of financial statement reporting. Therefore, for purposes of reporting Gross Asset Values for feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value for the feeder fund is included in Gross Asset Value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. For purposes of calculating the gross asset values in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), any uncalled commitment amounts are not included for each relevant private fund.  For purposes of reporting beneficial owners, for the feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the number of beneficial owners for the feeder fund is included in the beneficial owner value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund.  Note that Oaktree Capital Management (UK) LLP, Oaktree Capital Management (Dubai) Limited, Oaktree Capital (Hong Kong) Limited and Oaktree Japan, Inc. which act as marketers for certain private funds reported on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), do not conduct any respective marketing activities in the United States.   All funds with financial statements subject to an annual audit, listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), are audited by the same overarching auditing firm; however, in circumstances where the main fund and feeder fund are audited by entities of such auditing firm in separate jurisdictions, the specific entity auditing the feeder is not separately disclosed. The General Partner of certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) may make an investment through an Oaktree or Oaktree affiliate-managed Alternative Investment Vehicle (""AIV""). Each AIV is governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially similar to those of the fund to which they relate. Investments made through the AIVS are funded by contributions either directly to these entities or contributions to the funds to which they relate that are subsequently transferred to the AIV, such that in both cases investors will directly own a limited partnership interest in the AIV. Financial results for each AIV are reported on a consolidated basis with the fund to which they relate.  For certain private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) that are securitized asset funds, senior noteholders are treated as creditors while the income noteholders (who possess an equity-like claim on fund assets) are treated as beneficial owners of the fund for purposes of Ownership questions 13-16. In addition, for certain securitized asset funds, registrant has responded “No” to questions 23(G) and (H) due to the fact that such private funds do not obtain unaudited financial statements and thus the questions are not applicable.  For certain master funds included in Section 7.B.(1) that are part of master-feeder arrangements, we do not solicit clients to invest at the master fund level and therefore have answered “No” for Question A.19 of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds.  However, as the marketing materials and private placement memorandums include information regarding the fund complex as a whole (i.e. the master fund in a master-feeder arrangement appears in such documents along with the relevant feeder funds, even though no investors can invest directly in the master fund and may only invest in the fund complex through a feeder fund), we have answered “Yes” for Question B.28.(a) of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. For any other-than-annual amendment where we are adding private fund(s) to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the data reported is as of the last day of the prior fiscal quarter month end date.  All other responses are as of the last day of the prior fiscal year.  Please note that Oaktree Gardens OLP SPV, LP included in Section 7.B.(1) is a feeder fund to the Oaktree Gardens OLP, LLC which is a BDC managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. This feeder fund has been excluded from Regulatory Assets Under Management as those assets are reported in the Regulatory Assets Under Management for Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC.  Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC is a relying adviser structured as a limited liability company with multiple series. Identified in Section 4.A.2 of Schedule R are the direct owners of the management series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. The other series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC hold passive interests that do not confer control over the investment advisory activities of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. Accordingly, the owners of such other series have not been listed as direct owners in Section 4.A.2."

Bridgewater Associates Holdings, LLC, (""BAH LLC""), a Delaware limited liability company, is the sole General Partner and majority owner of Intermediate Holdings, and therefore the indirect majority owner of Bridgewater, as noted in Schedule B.  The Operating Board of Directors has the authority to oversee the business and operations of Bridgewater, subject to certain consent rights of Robert Prince and equity owners represented by Raymond Dalio over significant actions.  The members of the Operating Board represent various stakeholder constituencies within Bridgewater. The board is comprised of equity owners, the chief executive officer, other senior employees and outside directors.  None of Raymond Dalio, Robert Prince, Robert P. Prince 2016 Revocable Trust, Dalio Family Fund, Inc., or any other holder of BAH LLC units is generally able to exercise unilateral control of the Bridgewater entities.  Raymond Dalio, Robert Prince and Gregory Jensen are Members of the Board of Managers of BAH LLC.  Members of the Board of Managers (“Managers”) are responsible for governing BAH LLC.  In July 2024, Robert Prince transferred the BAH LLC equity owned by him to the Robert P. Prince 2016 Revocable Trust.  In September 2024, certain Dalio family trusts transferred equity in BAH LLC to Dalio Family Fund, Inc., a social welfare organization organized and operated under Section 501(c)(4) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Re: Item 5 and Item 9. The primary investment funds and separate accounts that we manage generally invest a significant portion of their assets directly or indirectly in other pooled vehicles (referred to as ""implementation funds"") which we also manage and through which we pursue our investment strategies for our primary funds and separate accounts (e.g. cash management investments are aggregated in a liquidity fund). These implementation funds do not charge management or incentive fees, do not have investors other than the funds and accounts that we manage, and are used solely for the purpose of obtaining efficient execution of our transactional activities and for reducing administrative burdens related to our primary funds and separate accounts. The assets of these implementation funds that were contributed by the primary funds and separate accounts have not been included in our RAUM or in our amount of custodied assets since we believe that, like a master feeder arrangement, this would result in the double counting of assets that we manage and custody.   Item 8A(1): Bridgewater makes investments in its funds for tax purposes and certain of our funds and separate account clients invest in our funds, including our implementation funds. Additionally, a small group of external investors,  have invested in Intermediate Holdings and BAH LLC. We did not advise the external investors in connection with their investment in Intermediate Holdings and BAH LLC or recommend it to them. We do not believe that any of the above transactions are within the scope of Item 8A(1).   Schedule D - 5K(2): We have calculated exposures and borrowings in a manner consistent with our approach to reporting such data for private funds on Form PF. Schedule D – 7.B.(1)(8): Bridgewater Pure Alpha Equity Overlay Fund, LLC (PFID 805-2320847158) and Bridgewater Corporate Bond Fund, LLC (PFID 805-1924960872) hold money market funds and similar instruments above the threshold for fund-of-fund classification in Section 7.B.(1)(8). However, because these funds are dormant as of 12/31/2022 and hold only money market funds and similar instruments we do not consider either to be a fund-of-fund and have answered accordingly. Regulatory Assets Under Management have been reported as of December 31, 2022.  Schedule D-7.B.(1)(23)a1 Bridgewater Pure Alpha Equity Overlay Fund, LLC (PFID 805-2320847158), and Bridgewater Corporate Bond Fund, LLC (PFID 805-1924960872) are dormant funds as of 12/31/2022 and no longer perform annual audits as they hold no investors.

1928593,"Oaktree’s asset management business is indirectly controlled by Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC (“BOH”) (formerly known as Oaktree Capital Group, LLC) and Oaktree Capital Holdings, LLC (“OCH”) (formerly known as Atlas OCM Holdings, LLC).  A majority of Oaktree’s business is owned by Brookfield Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (collectively, “Brookfield”) and the remainder is owned by current and former Oaktree executives and employees, and certain related individuals and entities.  Brookfield’s ownership interest in Oaktree’s business is held through BOH, OCH and related entities.  Brookfield and Oaktree operate their respective investment businesses largely independently, with each operating under its own brand and led by its existing management and investment teams, and Oaktree and Brookfield generally managing their investment operations independently of each other subject to an information barrier between the firms.  Oaktree does not consider Brookfield or its affiliates to be its “advisory affiliates” or “related persons” for purposes of this Form ADV.  For more information regarding Brookfield and its affiliates, please refer to the Form ADV of Brookfield affiliated investment advisers: Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC (CRD# 110497), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Canada, LP (CRD# 151605), Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Credit), LLC (CRD# 170811), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Adviser (Private Equity), L.P.

(CRD# 312797), Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Advisor LLC (CRD# 312792), and Brookfield Renewable Energy Group LLC (CRD# 316590).  Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. (“OCGH”) holds 100% of the Class B units of OCH which, during the period (the “Initial Period”, which is more specifically described in the Form 8-K filed October 4, 2019, available through EDGAR) from September 30, 2019 through , the date on which Brookfield delivers a written election to end the Initial Period (which election cannot be delivered before September 30, 2026 unless certain events occur before then), entitle OCGH to 10 votes per Class B unit on all matters to be submitted to a vote of the OCH members. In addition, during the Initial Period, the board of directors of Atlas OCM is comprised of two individuals selected by OCGH, two selected by Brookfield, and the remaining directors nominated by OCGH and subject to joint written appointment by each of OCGH and Brookfield.  As a result, during the Initial Period, OCGH will maintain actual control of Atlas OCM and, indirectly, the Registrant, although Atlas OCM is permitted to take certain actions without the consent of Brookfield.  The General Partner of the Limited Partnerships listed in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has the authority to waive the minimum investment requirement. Some of the Limited Partnerships for which the Registrant acts as General Partner or Investment Adviser are closed-end limited partnerships. As such, clients are not solicited to invest in such closed-end limited partnerships after the final closing has occurred. We have excluded from our disclosure limited partnerships and/or limited liability companies organized and operated solely for the benefit of our employees as well as any special purpose vehicles that were formed in relation to a specific investment or private fund.  For certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) of schedule D that are denominated in Euro, the Gross Asset Value and minimum investment commitment values have been converted to USD for purposes of reporting.  For all private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value has been rounded to the nearest thousands.  For purposes of Item 5: Information About Your Advisory Business – Regulatory Assets Under Management, Oaktree advises certain funds of funds that invest solely in other private funds advised by Oaktree, as noted in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. for purposes of calculating Regulatory Assets Under Management as reported in Item 5 and reporting of the Gross Asset Value of private funds in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the limited partner interests held in the other Oaktree private funds by the funds of funds have been excluded from the Gross Asset Values of such funds of funds.  As such, the Gross Asset Value of such funds of funds may be reported as zero in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), if such funds of funds have no other assets other than the limited partner interests in the other Oaktree private funds. In addition, feeder funds are consolidated with the main fund to which they relate for purposes of financial statement reporting. Therefore, for purposes of reporting Gross Asset Values for feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value for the feeder fund is included in Gross Asset Value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. For purposes of calculating the gross asset values in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), any uncalled commitment amounts are not included for each relevant private fund.  For purposes of reporting beneficial owners, for the feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the number of beneficial owners for the feeder fund is included in the beneficial owner value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund.  Note that Oaktree Capital Management (UK) LLP, Oaktree Capital Management (Dubai) Limited, Oaktree Capital (Hong Kong) Limited and Oaktree Japan, Inc. which act as marketers for certain private funds reported on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), do not conduct any respective marketing activities in the United States.   All funds with financial statements subject to an annual audit, listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), are audited by the same overarching auditing firm; however, in circumstances where the main fund and feeder fund are audited by entities of such auditing firm in separate jurisdictions, the specific entity auditing the feeder is not separately disclosed. The General Partner of certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) may make an investment through an Oaktree or Oaktree affiliate-managed Alternative Investment Vehicle (""AIV""). Each AIV is governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially similar to those of the fund to which they relate. Investments made through the AIVS are funded by contributions either directly to these entities or contributions to the funds to which they relate that are subsequently transferred to the AIV, such that in both cases investors will directly own a limited partnership interest in the AIV. Financial results for each AIV are reported on a consolidated basis with the fund to which they relate.  For certain private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) that are securitized asset funds, senior noteholders are treated as creditors while the income noteholders (who possess an equity-like claim on fund assets) are treated as beneficial owners of the fund for purposes of Ownership questions 13-16. In addition, for certain securitized asset funds, registrant has responded “No” to questions 23(G) and (H) due to the fact that such private funds do not obtain unaudited financial statements and thus the questions are not applicable.  For certain master funds included in Section 7.B.(1) that are part of master-feeder arrangements, we do not solicit clients to invest at the master fund level and therefore have answered “No” for Question A.19 of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds.  However, as the marketing materials and private placement memorandums include information regarding the fund complex as a whole (i.e. the master fund in a master-feeder arrangement appears in such documents along with the relevant feeder funds, even though no investors can invest directly in the master fund and may only invest in the fund complex through a feeder fund), we have answered “Yes” for Question B.28.(a) of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. For any other-than-annual amendment where we are adding private fund(s) to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the data reported is as of the last day of the prior fiscal quarter month end date.  All other responses are as of the last day of the prior fiscal year.  Please note that Oaktree Gardens OLP SPV, LP included in Section 7.B.(1) is a feeder fund to the Oaktree Gardens OLP, LLC which is a BDC managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. This feeder fund has been excluded from Regulatory Assets Under Management as those assets are reported in the Regulatory Assets Under Management for Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC.  Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC is a relying adviser structured as a limited liability company with multiple series. Identified in Section 4.A.2 of Schedule R are the direct owners of the management series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. The other series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC hold passive interests that do not confer control over the investment advisory activities of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. Accordingly, the owners of such other series have not been listed as direct owners in Section 4.A.2."

1928541,"FOR PURPOSES OF THIS MISCELLANEOUS SECTION, THE TERM ""REGISTRANT"" MEANS THE FILING ADVISER AND EACH RELYING ADVISER.   THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNT OF TOTAL REGULATORY ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CLIENTS WHO ARE NON-UNITED STATES PERSONS REPORTED IN ITEM 5.F.(3) IS THE SUM OF THE REGULATORY ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OF EACH CLIENT WHO IS A NON-UNITED STATES PERSON AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE SITUATION WHERE A CLIENT OF THE REGISTRANT MAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INVEST (OR HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP INTEREST) IN ANOTHER CLIENT.  REGULATORY ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REPORTED IN ITEM 5.F. AND ITEM 9 IS NOT THE SUM OF EACH CLIENT'S REGULATORY ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. RATHER, THIS CALCULATION TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THE SITUATION WHERE A CLIENT OF THE REGISTRANT MAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY INVEST (OR HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP INTEREST) IN ANOTHER CLIENT, SO AS NOT TO DOUBLE-COUNT ASSETS.  UNDER “SECTION 1.F. OTHER OFFICES”, IN RESPONSE TO WHETHER ANY OTHER INVESTMENT-RELATED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED FROM EACH OFFICE LOCATION IDENTIFIED, THE REGISTRANT’S RESPONSE IS LIMITED TO THE REGISTRANT.   SECTION 1.L. OF SCHEDULE D (LOCATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS) - CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS IDENTIFIED AS MAINTAINING REGISTRANT’S BOOKS AND RECORDS PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED STORAGE.

SUCH ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY OMITTED FROM THIS FORM ADV.  THE REGISTRANT CREATES AND OWNS ENTITIES THAT SERVE AS THE SUB-ADVISOR TO CERTAIN CLIENTS. THESE ENTITIES WERE CREATED SOLELY FOR TAX, LEGAL, REGULATORY AND/OR OTHER BUSINESS PURPOSES AND DO NOT ENGAGE IN INVESTMENT-RELATED ACTIVITY SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE ADVISORY ACTIVITIES PROVIDED BY THE REGISTRANT. THESE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY OMITTED FROM SECTION 7.B.(1) OF SCHEDULE D.   SECTION 7.B.(1) OF SCHEDULE D INCLUDES SECURITIZED ASSET FUNDS FOR WHICH THE REGISTRANT SERVES AS THE COLLATERAL MANAGER. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE UNDERLYING ASSETS IN SUCH CLIENTS ARE NOT MARKED TO MARKET AND ACTUAL VALUES MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT.

Schedule B - Accion International, the sole member of the Adviser, is a New York Not-For-Profit Corporation that has been granted 501(c)(3) status by the Internal Revenue Service. In accordance with New York law, Accion International does not have any owners or shareholders, nor is any person entitled to the organization's profit. As such, the Adviser has not listed any person(s) on Schedule B.  It should be noted that the regulatory assets under management in Item 5.F, gross asset value in Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), question 11 and the beneficial ownership information in Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), questions 13 – 16 are provided as of December 31, 2023.

In addition, successor rules do not apply to situations in which the predecessor intends to continue to engage in advisory activities. Otherwise, confusion may result as to the identities and registration statuses of the parties."
1926091,"Values relating to assets under management are partially estimated as of December 31, 2023. However, all values for Two Sigma Private Investments Fund, LLC (""TSPI Fund"") and SWC Funding LLC (""Securitized Asset Fund"") are as of September 30, 2023. A wholly owned subsidiary of TSPI Fund, Securitized Asset Fund has issued approximately $86,671,560 principal amount of notes for which Wells Fargo Bank, National Association acts as indenture trustee and which are owned by various unaffiliated institutional investors. The notes are secured by Securitized Asset Fund's interests in SWC Holding LLC (""Holding""). Holding's assets primarily consist of interests in various third party funds contributed to Holding by TSPI Fund. All equity interests in Holding are held by Securitized Asset Fund and the Securitized Asset Fund is consolidated onto the balance sheet of TSPI Fund. The Registrant's assets under management for the Securitized Asset Fund as reported in 7.B. reflects its gross assets, which is also reflected in the assets of the TSPI Fund reported in Item 7.B. Similarly with respect to Sightway Capital I (Domestic), LP (""Domestic""), the gross assets of that fund reflects a substantial investment by TSPI Fund which is also reflected in the assets of TSPI Fund reported in Item 7.B. However, for purposes of calculating the Registrant’s regulatory assets under management reported in Item 5.F., TSPI Fund’s portion of its respective investments in Holding and Domestic have been netted out. For that reason, the sum of the gross assets reported for each fund in Item 7.B. will exceed the regulatory assets under management reported in Item 5.F. In addition to commitments made by an investor to an investment vehicle, assets under management for any particular investment vehicle also reflects commitments that vehicle has to other funds.  On April 1, 2024, the Registrant completed a transaction pursuant to which its Two Sigma Impact business became an independent company named FoW Partners, LP (together with its affiliates, “FoW”). Accordingly, as of that date, the Registrant no longer provides advisory services to any of the investment vehicles that are now advised by FoW or its affiliates.  As such, the Registrant’s ADV no longer reflects the advisory operations and clients attributable this spun-out business."

With respect to question 1.F, the principal office and place of business of the Filing Adviser is located at the Filing Adviser’s U.S. address located at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022. The Filing Adviser has two investment management and administrative offices that direct the business of the Filing Adviser which are located in New York and London. Additionally, a branch office located in Florida was established in June 2018.   The Filing Adviser and each Relying Adviser, except for TFG Asset Management UK LLP, are ultimately controlled by the Filing Adviser's general partner, TFG Asset Management GP Ltd. (formerly known as Polygon Management Ltd.). Reade Griffith and Paddy Dear hold membership interests in TFG Asset Management UK LLP (as do certain other affiliated persons) and Pace Cayman Holdco Limited which collectively entitle them to exercise all of the voting rights in respect of the entity, subject to certain matters that require the approval of the Filing Adviser. EIML is controlled by Equitix 2020 Issuer Limited and is also an indirect owner in Pace Cayman Holdco Limited. Furthermore, each of Mr. Griffith and Mr. Dear has agreed that he will (i) exercise his voting rights in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of its indirect parent Tetragon Financial Group Limited (“Tetragon”) and (ii) upon the request of Tetragon, for nominal consideration, sell, transfer and deliver his membership interests in TFG Asset Management UK LLP to Tetragon.

TCI Capital Management LLC has a sub-advisory agreement with NYL Investors LLC with respect to TCI-FLATIRON CLO 2018-1 LTD.  Certain officers and employees (or their related persons) of the Filing Adviser and its affiliates may own interests in the Relying Advisers. All personnel acting on behalf of a Relying Adviser in connection with the performance of investment advisory services are individuals who are considered by the Filing Adviser to be persons associated with the Filing Adviser and whose activities are subject to the supervision and control of the Filing Adviser. As long as the Filing Adviser is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, each Relying Adviser will conduct its investment advisory activities as if it were itself so registered. In addition, the Filing Adviser has an affiliated registered investment adviser, Tetragon Financial Management LP (""TFM""), which has related persons that are not listed in Section 7.A of Schedule D. Information about Tetragon is available in the Form ADV of TFM. Tetragon, a client of TFM, may invest in private funds managed by certain of the Relying Advisers and Affiliated Adviser. Such investments have been included in the relevant calculations for purposes of answering questions 14, but excluded for purposes of answering questions 19 and 20 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D as they are made by a client of another registered investment adviser. Clients that act as ""feeder funds"" are disregarded for purposes of answering questions 14, 19 and 20 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D. With respect to LCM Asset Management LLC, LCM EURO LLC, and LCM EURO II LLC (together ""LCM"") and TCI CM, each Relying Advisers, due to the nature of the collateralized loan obligations (""CLOs"") (identified as securitized asset funds) that LCM and TCI CM manage as listed in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, the Filing Adviser, LCM, and TCI CM generally cannot access information regarding the beneficial ownership of the securities of the CLOs. Accordingly, we are unable to provide the information requested in questions 13, 15 and 16 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D. With respect to question 14 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, Tetragon, Tetragon Credit Income II L.P., Tetragon Credit Income III L.P., and Tetragon Credit Income IV L.P. may invest in certain CLOs that LCM and TCI CM manage and such amounts have been included in the relevant calculations. The amounts included for (1) LCM 41 Ltd., and (2) LCM 42 Ltd. are as of December 31, 2024. Moreover, with respect to such CLOs, the service providers listed as ""administrators"" and ""custodians"" in questions 25 and 26 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are trustees of such CLOs. Additionally, with respect to question 28 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, CLOs typically pay placement fees in connection with their establishment. The assets under management and custody figures reported in Item 5 and Item 9, respectively are as of December 31, 2023 and exclude (1) LCM 41 Ltd. and (2) LCM 42 Ltd. With respect to question 11 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, gross asset figures reported are as of December 31, 2023 except for (1) LCM 41 Ltd. and (2) LCM 42 Ltd. where figures are reported as of December 31, 2024.   With respect to Tetragon Credit Income III L.P. (“TCI III”), the assets of the fund are held in Tetragon Credit Income III LLC, risk retention series, a wholly owned subsidiary of TCI III, however, such amounts have been reflected in question 11 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D for TCI III.

Such amounts have been reflected in question 11 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D for TCI IV.  Please note – With respect to answering Item 5.F.(2)(b), the amount of Non-Discretionary Regulatory Assets Under Management (""Non-Discretionary RAUM"")  is 0, however, in order to submit this Annual Amendment as indicated by the IARD system, we had to enter an amount of Non-Discretionary RAUM that exceeded our number of non-discretionary accounts. Since we have 6 non-discretionary accounts/clients, we entered an amount of $7.00 in response to this question in order for the IARD system to allow us to submit the filing. The correct amount of RAUM for our 6 non-discretionary clients is 0. Furthermore, we also had to enter $7.00 in response to Item 5.D.(3)(n) although the correct amount is 0 in order for the total RAUM figure provided in Item 5.F.(2)(c) to match the sum of RAUM amounts provided for Item 5.D.(3).

UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THIS COULD LEAD TO A CONCLUSION THAT THE RELATED PERSON AND CALEDONIA HAVE CUSTODY OF CLIENT ASSETS.  HOWEVER, PURSUANT TO SEC INTERPRETATIONS SET FORTH IN THE “SEC STAFF RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CUSTODY RULE,” QUESTION VI.5, AND SEC STAFF LETTER TO THE ABA SUBCOMMITTEE ON PRIVATE INVESTMENT ENTITIES ISSUED AUGUST 10, 2006, OFFSHORE ADVISERS REGISTERED WITH THE SEC ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE CUSTODY RULE, WITH RESPECT TO OFFSHORE FUNDS.

1922929,"This other-than-annual amendment reflects the consummation of an internal reorganization pursuant to which GCM Customized Fund Investment Group, L.P. merged with and into Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P.  Post-reorganization, Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. was renamed to GCM Grosvenor L.P.  Except where otherwise expressly stated, data provided herein is as of 12/31/23.    General. Registrant currently provides investment management/advisory services to: (1) investment vehicles organized as legal entities (“GCM Investment Vehicles”); (2) accounts of non-fund clients (“GCM Managed Accounts” and, together with the GCM Investment Vehicles, the “GCM Funds”); and (3) certain institutional investors.    Item 5.B(2). GRV Securities LLC (“GSLLC”), an affiliate of Registrant, is a U.S.-registered broker-dealer. Certain employees of Registrant are registered representatives of GSLLC. GSLLC serves as placement agent or distributor for, among others, certain GCM Investment Vehicles. Registrant compensates GSLLC for serving as such placement agent or distributor on an annual flat fee basis.    Item 5.F(2) - Reflects Registrant’s regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) after adjusting for investments by some GCM Funds in other GCM Funds in order to avoid double counting Registrant’s RAUM. In certain cases where Registrant has been granted discretionary investment authority over GCM Funds, the investors/participants in those GCM Funds have informally reserved the right to approve or disapprove Registrant’s investment decisions for those GCM Funds prior to the implementation of such decisions.    Item 7 - Registrant’s investment management/advisory clients consist of: the GCM Investment Vehicles, holders of GCM Managed Accounts and certain institutional investors. Investors in the GCM Investment Vehicles are not, in their capacity as such, clients of Registrant. Accordingly, except as described below, although Registrant and its affiliated broker-dealers solicit prospective investors to invest in GCM Funds for which Registrant or an affiliate of Registrant is a general partner or investment manager, Registrant and its affiliated broker-dealers do not solicit Registrant’s clients to invest in GCM Funds for which Registrant or an affiliate of Registrant is a general partner or investment manager. Registrant may from time to time cause a GCM Fund to invest (or recommend that a GCM Funds invest) all or any portion of its assets in another GCM Fund, provided, among other things, that such investments have been adequately disclosed to participants in the GCM Funds involved, if such disclosure is material under the particular facts and circumstances, or, alternatively, if such investments are made on a basis that does not involve the payment of two levels of fees to Registrant. In addition, GCM Investments Japan K.K. (“GCM Japan”), a Japanese limited liability stock company of which Registrant is the sole shareholder, is registered as a securities company in Japan with the Kanto Local Finance Bureau. GCM Japan may act as a discretionary investment manager on behalf of its clients in Japan and, in that connection, may allocate its client assets to one or more GCM Funds.    Item 8.g(1). Registrant does not separately compensate financial intermediaries for the provision of non-execution related services and Registrant does not believe that it “pays up” for such services. However, Registrant may from time to time use financial intermediaries that provide research-related products or services to most or all of their customers, and - although Registrant does not request research-related products or services from such financial intermediaries - Registrant may on occasion receive and use research provided by such intermediaries. GCM Grosvenor may receive complimentary or discounted use of third-party cash management software from banking institutions in exchange for maintaining cash deposits or cash-equivalent investments (e.g., money market accounts) with such institutions, resulting in a potential conflict of interest when determining where to make such deposits or investments.    Item 9 - Master and feeder funds with different general partners will report AUM at the feeder fund level and will individually count each fund in the structure in sections 9.A and 9.B respectively.    Item 9.B.2 - RAUM data and information set forth in responses for Registrant’s Funds investing in private equity, infrastructure, and real estate are based, in part, on the most recent value of investments reported by the managers of such investments, adjusted for cash flows, where applicable. Co-investment data is based on the 9/30/23 fair value, which is the most recent fair value available to the Registrant, adjusted for cash flows, where applicable. Foreign-denominated funds are converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of 12/31/23. Schedule D Section 7.B.1.26 - the Registrant has engaged third party service providers to support the fund accounting and administration functions of the Registrant for certain of the Registrant’s private investment funds.   Schedule D Section 7.B. - Given the publicly available nature of the Form ADV, it is our reasonable belief that the Adviser and its clients would suffer substantial, irreparable business and reputational harm, upon a disclosure of the sub-advisers to Belmont Harbor Master Fund, L.P. that are unaffiliated with the Adviser, due to the highly sensitive confidential trade secrets and intellectual property associated with that commercial information. Accordingly, we have omitted this information and will make it available to the SEC upon request."

Category (g), “Pension and profit sharing plans (but not the plan participants or government pension plans), individual clients that were previously included in this category are now included individual categories.  Section 5.K.(1) Asset Categories Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC. used the following methodology to determine how to categorize assets that could be classified in more than one category: 1.            Common stock, preferred securities, structured products and units are included in the Exchange-Traded Equity Securities category if the security traded on a national exchange and within the Non Exchange-Traded Equity Securities category if they do not traded on a national exchange.  2.            Investment Grade Corporate Bonds include corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of BBB or higher and a Moody’s rating of Baa or higher. Corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of below BBB or a Moody’s rating below Baa are categorized as Non-Investment Grade Corporate Bonds.  Those securities given opposing ratings by Moody’s and S&P (investment-grade and non-investment grade) automatically default to the non-investment grade category.  3.            Annuities have characteristics that are not primarily representative of any of the defined asset categories, therefore annuity products are listed in the Other category.   4.

Option notional values were calculated without being adjusted for delta.  2017 RAUM was duplicated by the number of assets in each account causing RAUM to be overstated and some accounts to be represented in the wrong exposure level.

1931854,"Oaktree’s asset management business is indirectly controlled by Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC (“BOH”) (formerly known as Oaktree Capital Group, LLC) and Oaktree Capital Holdings, LLC (“OCH”) (formerly known as Atlas OCM Holdings, LLC).  A majority of Oaktree’s business is owned by Brookfield Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (collectively, “Brookfield”) and the remainder is owned by current and former Oaktree executives and employees, and certain related individuals and entities.  Brookfield’s ownership interest in Oaktree’s business is held through BOH, OCH and related entities.  Brookfield and Oaktree operate their respective investment businesses largely independently, with each operating under its own brand and led by its existing management and investment teams, and Oaktree and Brookfield generally managing their investment operations independently of each other subject to an information barrier between the firms.  Oaktree does not consider Brookfield or its affiliates to be its “advisory affiliates” or “related persons” for purposes of this Form ADV.  For more information regarding Brookfield and its affiliates, please refer to the Form ADV of Brookfield affiliated investment advisers: Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC (CRD# 110497), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Canada, LP (CRD# 151605), Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Credit), LLC (CRD# 170811), Brookfield Asset Management PIC Adviser (Private Equity), L.P. (CRD# 171207),  Brookfield Asset Management PIC U.S. LLC (CRD# 151599), Brookfield Asset Management PIC BMG, LLC. (CRD# 312797), Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Advisor LLC (CRD# 312792), and Brookfield Renewable Energy Group LLC (CRD# 316590).  Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. (“OCGH”) holds 100% of the Class B units of OCH which, during the period (the “Initial Period”, which is more specifically described in the Form 8-K filed October 4, 2019, available through EDGAR) from September 30, 2019 through , the date on which Brookfield delivers a written election to end the Initial Period (which election cannot be delivered before September 30, 2026 unless certain events occur before then), entitle OCGH to 10 votes per Class B unit on all matters to be submitted to a vote of the OCH members. In addition, during the Initial Period, the board of directors of Atlas OCM is comprised of two individuals selected by OCGH, two selected by Brookfield, and the remaining directors nominated by OCGH and subject to joint written appointment by each of OCGH and Brookfield.  As a result, during the Initial Period, OCGH will maintain actual control of Atlas OCM and, indirectly, the Registrant, although Atlas OCM is permitted to take certain actions without the consent of Brookfield.  The General Partner of the Limited Partnerships listed in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has the authority to waive the minimum investment requirement. Some of the Limited Partnerships for which the Registrant acts as General Partner or Investment Adviser are closed-end limited partnerships. As such, clients are not solicited to invest in such closed-end limited partnerships after the final closing has occurred. We have excluded from our disclosure limited partnerships and/or limited liability companies organized and operated solely for the benefit of our employees as well as any special purpose vehicles that were formed in relation to a specific investment or private fund.  For certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) of schedule D that are denominated in Euro, the Gross Asset Value and minimum investment commitment values have been converted to USD for purposes of reporting.  For all private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value has been rounded to the nearest thousands.  For purposes of Item 5: Information About Your Advisory Business – Regulatory Assets Under Management, Oaktree advises certain funds of funds that invest solely in other private funds advised by Oaktree, as noted in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. for purposes of calculating Regulatory Assets Under Management as reported in Item 5 and reporting of the Gross Asset Value of private funds in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the limited partner interests held in the other Oaktree private funds by the funds of funds have been excluded from the Gross Asset Values of such funds of funds.  As such, the Gross Asset Value of such funds of funds may be reported as zero in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), if such funds of funds have no other assets other than the limited partner interests in the other Oaktree private funds. In addition, feeder funds are consolidated with the main fund to which they relate for purposes of financial statement reporting. Therefore, for purposes of reporting Gross Asset Values for feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value for the feeder fund is included in Gross Asset Value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. For purposes of calculating the gross asset values in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), any uncalled commitment amounts are not included for each relevant private fund.  For purposes of reporting beneficial owners, for the feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the number of beneficial owners for the feeder fund is included in the beneficial owner value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund.  Note that Oaktree Capital Management (UK) LLP, Oaktree Capital Management (Dubai) Limited, Oaktree Capital (Hong Kong) Limited and Oaktree Japan, Inc. which act as marketers for certain private funds reported on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), do not conduct any respective marketing activities in the United States.   All funds with financial statements subject to an annual audit, listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), are audited by the same overarching auditing firm; however, in circumstances where the main fund and feeder fund are audited by entities of such auditing firm in separate jurisdictions, the specific entity auditing the feeder is not separately disclosed. The General Partner of certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) may make an investment through an Oaktree or Oaktree affiliate-managed Alternative Investment Vehicle (""AIV""). Each AIV is governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially similar to those of the fund to which they relate. Investments made through the AIVS are funded by contributions either directly to these entities or contributions to the funds to which they relate that are subsequently transferred to the AIV, such that in both cases investors will directly own a limited partnership interest in the AIV. Financial results for each AIV are reported on a consolidated basis with the fund to which they relate.  For certain private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) that are securitized asset funds, senior noteholders are treated as creditors while the income noteholders (who possess an equity-like claim on fund assets) are treated as beneficial owners of the fund for purposes of Ownership questions 13-16. In addition, for certain securitized asset funds, registrant has responded “No” to questions 23(G) and (H) due to the fact that such private funds do not obtain unaudited financial statements and thus the questions are not applicable.  For certain master funds included in Section 7.B.(1) that are part of master-feeder arrangements, we do not solicit clients to invest at the master fund level and therefore have answered “No” for Question A.19 of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds.  However, as the marketing materials and private placement memorandums include information regarding the fund complex as a whole (i.e. the master fund in a master-feeder arrangement appears in such documents along with the relevant feeder funds, even though no investors can invest directly in the master fund and may only invest in the fund complex through a feeder fund), we have answered “Yes” for Question B.28.(a) of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. For any other-than-annual amendment where we are adding private fund(s) to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the data reported is as of the last day of the prior fiscal quarter month end date.  All other responses are as of the last day of the prior fiscal year.  Please note that Oaktree Gardens OLP SPV, LP included in Section 7.B.(1) is a feeder fund to the Oaktree Gardens OLP, LLC which is a BDC managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. This feeder fund has been excluded from Regulatory Assets Under Management as those assets are reported in the Regulatory Assets Under Management for Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC.  Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC is a relying adviser structured as a limited liability company with multiple series. Identified in Section 4.A.2 of Schedule R are the direct owners of the management series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. The other series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC hold passive interests that do not confer control over the investment advisory activities of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. Accordingly, the owners of such other series have not been listed as direct owners in Section 4.A.2."

THUS, THE RAUM INCLUDES GROSS ASSETS THAT ARE COUNTED MULTIPLE TIMES TO THE EXTENT SUCH FEEDER FUNDS AND SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS INVEST IN OTHER CLIENTS OF THE REGISTRANT. SIMILARLY, SCHEDULE D, SECTION 7.B(1) DISCLOSES THE RAUM OF EACH PRIVATE FUND, WHICH INCLUDES THE PRIVATE FUND'S INVESTMENTS IN OTHER CLIENTS OF THE REGISTRANT (“CROSS INVESTMENTS”).

The date of the filed succession was incorrectly stated as 9/12/2024. This was the filing date to the California Secretary of State for the change. Subsequently, the firm sent IRS Form 8832 on 9/18/2024 and awaited a response from the state.  Counsel advised the firm on October 18, 2024 that the ""F-Reorg"" was completed and confirmed the firm was able to notify and update vendors, custodians, and regulatory organizations of the change. The firm then began notifying relevant parties and communicated the name change to its staff. As this notification did not come until October 18, 2024, that is the effective date of the succession, and the date that should have been used for the ADV amendment. Further, there was no change in the tax ID number and ownership ultimately remains the same as before as Highline Holdings, Inc. is a disregarded entity that is wholly owned by Jonathan Rugg. The firm requests that the succession date be correctly recorded as October 18, 2024. Therefore, the firm's succession filing on October 22, 2024 was filed within the 30-day notice period and should not be deficient."

To comply with the requirements of the Custody Rule, these funds undergo surprise custody audits by an independent CPA firm. An audit that follows the income tax basis of accounting, generally commences once the tax return is completed, because this would reflect the timing in which the K-1s are received from the underlying asset managers. As a result, the audit generally occurs following the completion of a fund's tax return and will not occur within 120 days of the respective fund’s fiscal year end (180 days in the case of a fund of funds),as required under the Custody Rule.   (2) A 2023 audit will not be conducted for the below funds because there was no activity or assets in the fund in 2023.
