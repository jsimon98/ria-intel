THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVES THE SEC'S CHARGES THAT WACHOVIA MISLED INVESTORS REGARDING THE LIQUIDITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS THAT IT UNDERWROTE, MARKETED AND SOLD. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA AND ANOTHER FIRM, WHOSE BROKER-DEALER OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO WACHOVIA MISREPRESENTED TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARS WERE SAFE, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT WERE COMPARABLE TO CASH OR MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT, WACHOVIA REINFORCED THE PERCEPTION OF LIQUIDITY BY ROUTINELY PURCHASING ARS FROM THE OTHER FIRM'S CUSTOMERS BETWEEN AUCTIONS, WITHOUT TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT WACHOVIA'S WILLINGNESS TO DO SO DEPENDED UPON THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE AUCTIONS. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA BECAME AWARE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT PUT THE FIRM ON NOTICE THAT THE RISK OF AUCTION FAILURES HAD MATERIALLY INCREASED. WACHOVIA, NEVERTHELESS, CONTINUED TO MARKET ARS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AS HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS. WACHOVIA FOLLOWED THE LEAD OF OTHER BROKER-DEALERS AND DECIDED TO STOP SUPPORTING AUCTIONS.

WACHOVIA'S BUYBACK HAS TWO PHASES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, WHICH ENDED ON NOV. 28, 2008, WACHOVIA OFFERED TO PURCHASE ARS HELD BY NATURAL PERSONS, NOT-FOR-PROFIT AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR OTHER ACCOUNTS WITH ACCOUNT VALUES OR HOUSEHOLD VALUES UP TO $10 MILLION.
