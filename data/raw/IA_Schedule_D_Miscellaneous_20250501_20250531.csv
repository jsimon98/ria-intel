1992086,"**Regarding Items 5.A. and 5.B. (Employees), the Adviser is party to an arrangement with ACON Investments, L.L.C. (“ACON Investments”), pursuant to which ACON Investments provides the services of various private equity fund investment, finance, accounting, tax, legal, ESG, investor relations, compliance and support professionals to the Adviser. Most of the employees and independent contractors that work with ACON are not engaged by the Adviser directly. The Adviser’s answers to Items 5.A. and 5.B.(1) reflect the number of employees and independent contractors of ACON Investments who perform work, pursuant to this arrangement, for the Adviser (i.e., as if for purposes of this Item 5, the Adviser, instead of ACON Investments, has engaged such persons directly). **Regarding Items 5.D.(3) (Clients), 5.F. (Regulatory Assets Under Management) and 9.B.(2) (Custody), the Adviser uses the same methodology for reporting its regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) in both Part 1A and 2A of the Form ADV. Instructions for Item 5.F. of Part 1A of the Form ADV provide that, in determining the amount of a registered adviser’s RAUM, an adviser should “include the entire value of each securities portfolio for which [it] provide[s] continuous and regular supervisory or management services.” The Adviser provides management services to one or more Investment Vehicles (as defined in the Brochure) advised by affiliates of the Adviser. In some cases, an Investment Vehicle will aggregate certain investors’ interests alongside a particular Investment Vehicle’s share of invested capital in respect of such portfolio investment. In reporting RAUM, ACON eliminates double counting of assets in such situations where an ACON Investment Vehicle invests in another Investment Vehicle. The total amount of RAUM reported in Item 5.F.(2)(c) therefore will equal the total amount reported in Item 5.D.(3). Instructions for Item 9.B.(2) of Part 1A of the Form ADV provide that, we shall include “the approximate amount of client funds and securities and total number of clients for which your related persons have custody.” The Adviser and its related persons reported in Item 7.A. have custody of all the client funds and securities reported in Item 5.D.(3). **To calculate RAUM for purposes of the response to Item 5.F.(2), the Adviser has included each account’s (i) fair value, (ii) cash and other assets and (iii) any unfunded capital (which includes uncalled capital commitments and recyclable capital). **In the responses to Item 7.B. (Private Fund Reporting) on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), Question A.11. for each of the Adviser’s private funds, the calculation of “gross asset value” includes all assets that are included in the private fund’s calculation of “regulatory assets under management,” including the amount of uncalled capital commitments. The sum of the gross asset values listed in aggregate for each of the Adviser’s private fund clients will exceed the RAUM calculation listed in Item 5.F.(2), because “gross asset value” on a fund-by-fund basis will not exclude portions of other private funds to eliminate “double counting.” **Certain of the Adviser’s related persons listed in Item 7.A. (Financial Industry Affiliations) on Schedule D, Section 7.A. are special purpose vehicles formed to act as the general partners or managing members of certain of the Adviser’s private fund clients. In reliance on the SEC Staff’s No Action Letter to the American Bar Association dated January 18, 2012, such related persons will be covered by the Adviser’s registration and deemed to be registered by the SEC."

Additionally, for purposes of reporting the gross assets of the applicable hedge fund, any such amount that has not been called by Growth V has been included in the applicable hedge fund’s assets.  As of December 31, 2024, a total of $16,208,361 of capital in Coatue Offshore Fund Ltd. and Coatue Qualified Partners, L.P. is committed to Growth V via the hybrid option and subject to capital calls.  In connection with the information included in Schedule D, Item 7.B.1. subpart 23(a) for CK Liquidating Vehicle LP, this entity did not have any assets during the entirety of calendar year 2024 and accordingly was not audited with respect to that year. Coatue Management has responded “no” for Item 8.A.1. due to the fact that it does not engage in principal transactions in the ordinary course of its business, however, from time to time (particularly in connection with the funding of certain investments in private companies due to the expedited timing of funding such transactions), Coatue Management has previously in limited circumstances and expects in the future that it may enter into a principal transaction with a Client.

REGULATORY ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REPORTED IN ITEM 5.F. AND ITEM 9 IS NOT THE SUM OF EACH CLIENT'S REGULATORY ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.

Beneficial owners who formalized their commitment subsequent to this capital call but did not participate in it have not been included in the count for this question.

If FRS places an insurance product or refers one of our clients to an insurance broker and there is a purchase of insurance through the broker, then FRS will receive a portion of the upfront and/or ongoing commissions associated with the sale by the insurance carrier with which the policy was placed. The amount of insurance commission revenue earned by FRS is considered for purposes of determining the amount of additional compensation that certain of our financial professionals are entitled to receive.

Certain Funds qualify for and rely upon one or more exclusions from registration under the Company Act, other than, or in addition to Section 3(c)(1) and/or Section 3(c)(7) thereof. Certain of such Funds have elected to rely on those other exclusions and, therefore, do not currently constitute “private funds” for purposes of the Advisers Act, Form ADV or Form PF. However out of abundance of caution, and pursuant to the strictest interpretation of the Adviser Act, reliance on such other exclusions has not been determined to preclude such Funds from potentially being deemed securities portfolios, and for such assets to be considered regulatory assets under management."
1991771,"UPTIQ Treasury & Credit Solutions, LLC (together with UPTIQ, Inc. and its affiliates, “UPTIQ”) facilitates credit and cash management solutions for our clients.  We are a wholly owned subsidiary of Focus Financial Partners, LLC (“Focus”), and Focus is a minority investor in UPTIQ, Inc.  The range of services offered or expected to be offered by UPTIQ to our advisory clients includes, but is not limited to, omnibus cash management products, individual level deposits, non-purpose securities-backed lines of credit, commercial loans, aircraft and marine loans, non-securities-based/asset-secured loans, and residential mortgage loans.  When legally permissible, UPTIQ shares a portion of this earned revenue with an affiliate of our firm.   Our affiliate, Focus Risk Solutions, LLC (“FRS”), assists our clients with regulated insurance sales activity by advising our clients on insurance matters and placing insurance products for them and/or referring our clients to licensed insurance brokers, which either separately or together with FRS, place insurance products for them. Certain of these brokers pay FRS periodic fees to participate in the FRS platform and, thereby, to offer their services to our clients and certain of our affiliates’ clients. If FRS places an insurance product or refers one of our clients to an insurance broker and there is a purchase of insurance through the broker, then FRS will receive a portion of the upfront and/or ongoing commissions associated with the sale by the insurance carrier with which the policy was placed. The amount of insurance commission revenue earned by FRS is considered for purposes of determining the amount of additional compensation that certain of our financial professionals are entitled to receive.  The firm maintains a list of related persons who are not listed in Section 7.A because (1) the firm has no business dealings with the related person in connection with the advisory services it provides to clients; (2) it does not conduct shared operations with the related person; (3) it does not refer clients or business to the related person, and the related person does not refer prospective clients or business to the firm; (4) the firm does not share supervised persons or premises with the related person; and (5) the firm has no reason to believe that its relationship with the related person otherwise creates a conflict of interest with its clients.  A portion of the client funds and clients reported in Item 9 are reported as having custody due to third party standing instructions (“SLOAs”) authorizing transfers to third parties. In regard to these SLOAs, an independent public accountant has not conducted a surprise asset examination consistent with the SEC no-action letter to the Investment Adviser Association dated February 1, 2017. Additionally, we report having custody due to having more than read-only/trade-only PIN/password access to client accounts, serving as trustee on client accounts, and having discretion on charitable accounts. Each of these client accounts for which we report having custody is subject to the surprise asset examination."

(“ACON Investments”), pursuant to which ACON Investments provides the services of various private equity fund investment, finance, accounting, tax, legal, ESG, investor relations, compliance and support professionals to the Adviser. Most of the employees and independent contractors that work with ACON are not engaged by the Adviser directly. The Adviser’s answers to Items 5.A.  and 5.B.(1) reflect the number of employees and independent contractors of ACON Investments who perform work, pursuant to this arrangement, for the Adviser (i.e., as if for purposes of this Item 5, the Adviser, instead of ACON Investments, has engaged such persons directly). **Regarding Items 5.D.(3) (Clients), 5.F. (Regulatory Assets Under Management) and 9.B.(2) (Custody), the Adviser uses the same methodology for reporting its regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) in both Part 1A and 2A of the Form ADV. Instructions for Item 5.F. of Part 1A of the Form ADV provide that, in determining the amount of a registered adviser’s RAUM, an adviser should “include the entire value of each securities portfolio for which [it] provide[s] continuous and regular supervisory or management services.” The Adviser provides management services to one or more Investment Vehicles (as defined in the Brochure) advised by affiliates of the Adviser. In some cases, an Investment Vehicle will aggregate certain investors’ interests alongside a particular Investment Vehicle’s share of invested capital in respect of such portfolio investment. In reporting RAUM, ACON eliminates double counting of assets in such situations where an ACON Investment Vehicle invests in another Investment Vehicle. The total amount of RAUM reported in Item 5.F.(2)(c) therefore will equal the total amount reported in Item 5.D.(3). Instructions for Item 9.B.(2) of Part 1A of the Form ADV provide that, we shall include “the approximate amount of client funds and securities and total number of clients for which your related persons have custody.” The Adviser and its related persons reported in Item 7.A. have custody of all the client funds and securities reported in Item 5.D.(3). **To calculate RAUM for purposes of the response to Item 5.F.(2), the Adviser has included each account’s (i) fair value, (ii) cash and other assets and (iii) any unfunded capital (which includes uncalled capital commitments and recyclable capital). Where applicable, the fair value of certain portfolio companies has been converted from the applicable foreign currency to U.S. Dollars based on the market rate at the end of the reporting year. **In the responses to Item 7.B. (Private Fund Reporting) on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), Question A.11. for each of the Adviser’s private funds, the calculation of “gross asset value” includes all assets that are included in the private fund’s calculation of “regulatory assets under management,” including the amount of uncalled capital commitments. The sum of the gross asset values listed in aggregate for each of the Adviser’s private fund clients will exceed the RAUM calculation listed in Item 5.F.(2), because “gross asset value” on a fund-by-fund basis will not exclude portions of other private funds to eliminate “double counting.” **Certain of the Adviser’s related persons listed in Item 7.A. (Financial Industry Affiliations) on Schedule D, Section 7.A. are special purpose vehicles formed to act as the general partners or managing members of certain of the Adviser’s private fund clients. In reliance on the SEC Staff’s No Action Letter to the American Bar Association dated January 18, 2012, such related persons will be covered by the Adviser’s registration and deemed to be registered by the SEC."

1991752,"ITEM 4:  Advisory Business Principal Owners Andrew E. Canter is the Principal and President of Canter Wealth, owning more than 75% of the firm.  Certain other Partners and employees own minority stakes in the firm (<25%), which may increase based on the attainment of specific assets under management (""AUM"") targets.  The realization of AUM targets will result in Andrew E. Canter's firm ownership incrementally decreasing as triggered by employee equity compensation. (Please refer to Item 10:  Other Financial Industry Activities & Affiliations for further details, and Form ADV Part 2Bs for Principal Owners' formal education and business backgrounds.)  ITEM 10:  Other Financial Industry Activities & Affiliations Real Estate Broker Or Dealer  Canter Wealth HoldCo, LLC, is an owner of Canter Wealth. Canter Wealth HoldCo, LLC is wholly owned by The Canter Group, LLC.  The Canter Group, LLC is wholly owned by Canter Holdings, LLC, wholly owned by Andrew E. Canter, through a Trust.     The Canter Group operates a range of businesses through controlled entities, collectively referred to as the ""Canter Companies,"" described below.  To the extent clients of Canter Wealth also use one or more of the Canter Companies' services, the activities and fees of the Canter Companies will be important to understand.  Canter Wealth advisory clients should be aware that when they are using the services of affiliated entities of Canter Wealth, such services are not provided by Canter Wealth, are subject to separate contractual arrangements, and are not part of the advisory services offered by Canter Wealth.  Moreover, the protections afforded to a client under applicable investment advisory laws and regulations generally do not apply to the services provided by non-advisory affiliates. From time to time and when appropriate for a client, Advisor Representatives of Canter Wealth will recommend that such clients consider other affiliated Canter Companies' services. Personnel of other Canter Companies also retain the discretion to introduce non-advisory clients to Canter Wealth.  This presents a conflict of interest since the Canter Group, LLC, will receive additional compensation if a Canter Wealth advisory client elects to utilize another of the Canter Companies' services.    The following are affiliated businesses owned and operated by the Canter Companies: •Canter Management, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is in the business of managing real estate holdings. •Canter Capital, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, seeks private investment opportunities related to Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Private Real Estate Investments.   •Canter Development, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is a real estate developer currently active in the San Diego market. •Iconic Property Management, Inc. - A Canter Group subsidiary is a real estate property manager. •Canter Real Estate Group, Inc. - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is a pass-through entity partnered with an independent and unaffiliated real estate brokerage firm (Compass).  Certain Canter Wealth's Advisor Representatives are licensed real estate agents of an independent and unaffiliated real-estate brokerage and agency.  Advisor Representatives offer clients advice or services from Canter Companies or other non-related parties from time to time.  The ultimate decision to retain these particular services remains within the sole discretion of the client. Clients should be aware that these services involve a conflict of interest due to the additional compensation received in connection with the transaction. Canter Wealth addresses this conflict of interest by requiring Associates to always act in each client's best interests and fully disclose such relationships when making recommendations.  Associates satisfy this requirement by advising clients of the nature of the transaction or relationship, noting their role in the transaction, and disclosing any compensation to be received by them in connection with the transaction, including commissions and trails, if applicable.     Other Material Relationships or Arrangements With The Financial Industry Stifel Effective March 2019, Canter Wealth entered into a relationship with Stifel, a registered broker-dealer and self-clearing firm (member NYSE, FINRA, SIPC).  Stifel will serve as TD's clearing broker for select securities.  Client transactions in these securities will be executed in TD's custodial account for the benefit of Canter Wealth and delivered on the settlement date to TD against payment in full by TD on Canter Wealth's client's behalf.  TriVant Custom Portfolio Group Canter Wealth previously maintained a third-party advisory relationship with TriVant Custom Portfolio Group, LLC. As of February 15th, 2018, Canter Wealth and TriVant discontinued this relationship. For any client remaining with TriVant Custom Portfolio Group, LLC, after February 15, 2018, TriVant will pay Canter Wealth 50% of the management fee/revenue share TriVant receives until each remaining client closes their account. TriVant's clients are no longer clients of Canter Wealth; we have discontinued the direct relationship with such clients.   Conflicts Of Interest  Outside of the relationship referenced herein, neither the adviser nor any of its management persons have any other material relationships or conflicts of interest with any financial industry participants. Canter Wealth makes no assurance that the products or the products of another entity are offered at the lowest available cost.  Clients are under no obligation to implement any recommended transaction(s) through any other recommended entity and are not obligated to utilize any of the Canter Companies' services.  Additional details of how Canter Wealth mitigates conflicts of interest can be found in the firm's comprehensive written supervisory Compliance Policies & Procedures Manual and its Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics is available free for review upon request to any client or prospective client."

Certain other Partners and employees own minority stakes in the firm (<25%), which may increase based on the attainment of specific assets under management (""AUM"") targets.  The realization of AUM targets will result in Andrew E. Canter's firm ownership incrementally decreasing as triggered by employee equity compensation. (Please refer to Item 10:  Other Financial Industry Activities & Affiliations for further details, and Form ADV Part 2Bs for Principal Owners' formal education and business backgrounds.)  ITEM 10:  Other Financial Industry Activities & Affiliations Real Estate Broker Or Dealer  Canter Wealth HoldCo, LLC, is an owner of Canter Wealth. Canter Wealth HoldCo, LLC is wholly owned by The Canter Group, LLC.  The Canter Group, LLC is wholly owned by Canter Holdings, LLC, wholly owned by Andrew E. Canter, through a Trust.     The Canter Group operates a range of businesses through controlled entities, collectively referred to as the ""Canter Companies,"" described below.  To the extent clients of Canter Wealth also use one or more of the Canter Companies' services, the activities and fees of the Canter Companies will be important to understand.  Canter Wealth advisory clients should be aware that when they are using the services of affiliated entities of Canter Wealth, such services are not provided by Canter Wealth, are subject to separate contractual arrangements, and are not part of the advisory services offered by Canter Wealth.  Moreover, the protections afforded to a client under applicable investment advisory laws and regulations generally do not apply to the services provided by non-advisory affiliates. From time to time and when appropriate for a client, Advisor Representatives of Canter Wealth will recommend that such clients consider other affiliated Canter Companies' services. Personnel of other Canter Companies also retain the discretion to introduce non-advisory clients to Canter Wealth.  This presents a conflict of interest since the Canter Group, LLC, will receive additional compensation if a Canter Wealth advisory client elects to utilize another of the Canter Companies' services.    The following are affiliated businesses owned and operated by the Canter Companies: •Canter Management, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is in the business of managing real estate holdings. •Canter Capital, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, seeks private investment opportunities related to Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Private Real Estate Investments.   •Canter Development, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is a real estate developer currently active in the San Diego market. •Iconic Property Management, Inc. - A Canter Group subsidiary is a real estate property manager. •Canter Real Estate Group, Inc. - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is a pass-through entity partnered with an independent and unaffiliated real estate brokerage firm (Compass).  Certain Canter Wealth's Advisor Representatives are licensed real estate agents of an independent and unaffiliated real-estate brokerage and agency.  Advisor Representatives offer clients advice or services from Canter Companies or other non-related parties from time to time.  The ultimate decision to retain these particular services remains within the sole discretion of the client. Clients should be aware that these services involve a conflict of interest due to the additional compensation received in connection with the transaction. Canter Wealth addresses this conflict of interest by requiring Associates to always act in each client's best interests and fully disclose such relationships when making recommendations.  Associates satisfy this requirement by advising clients of the nature of the transaction or relationship, noting their role in the transaction, and disclosing any compensation to be received by them in connection with the transaction, including commissions and trails, if applicable.     Other Material Relationships or Arrangements With The Financial Industry Stifel Effective March 2019, Canter Wealth entered into a relationship with Stifel, a registered broker-dealer and self-clearing firm (member NYSE, FINRA, SIPC).  Stifel will serve as TD's clearing broker for select securities.  Client transactions in these securities will be executed in TD's custodial account for the benefit of Canter Wealth and delivered on the settlement date to TD against payment in full by TD on Canter Wealth's client's behalf.  TriVant Custom Portfolio Group Canter Wealth previously maintained a third-party advisory relationship with TriVant Custom Portfolio Group, LLC. As of February 15th, 2018, Canter Wealth and TriVant discontinued this relationship. For any client remaining with TriVant Custom Portfolio Group, LLC, after February 15, 2018, TriVant will pay Canter Wealth 50% of the management fee/revenue share TriVant receives until each remaining client closes their account. TriVant's clients are no longer clients of Canter Wealth; we have discontinued the direct relationship with such clients.   Conflicts Of Interest  Outside of the relationship referenced herein, neither the adviser nor any of its management persons have any other material relationships or conflicts of interest with any financial industry participants. Canter Wealth makes no assurance that the products or the products of another entity are offered at the lowest available cost.  Clients are under no obligation to implement any recommended transaction(s) through any other recommended entity and are not obligated to utilize any of the Canter Companies' services.  Additional details of how Canter Wealth mitigates conflicts of interest can be found in the firm's comprehensive written supervisory Compliance Policies & Procedures Manual and its Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics is available free for review upon request to any client or prospective client."

Item 7.A.: The Related Person 40|86 Mortgage Capital, Inc. was identified as a “real estate broker or dealer” because it underwrites and originates commercial real estate loans and services certain of those loans.

However, CreekSource 2024-1 (Dunes Creek) CLO, Ltd. was newly formed, and no such third-party report was produced as of December 31, 2024.

Morgan Securities LLC, to privately place various tranches of its debt securities with qualified institutional investors. Subsequent to the initial placement of such securities, the holders thereof may engage in exchange transactions, through the Depository Trust Corporation or otherwise, of which CreekSource LLC and 40|86 Advisors, Inc. would not be aware. In any case, CreekSource LLC and 40|86 Advisors, Inc. do not have the information necessary to respond to questions 13, 14, 15 and 16 with respect to the third-party holders of such debt securities.

Item 5(A)(1) – We have reported the number of employees of Voleon Capital Management LP (excluding clerical workers) and certain employees of affiliated entities that provide services to the firm. The total number of employees would be higher if we included people employed by all affiliated entities.   Item 5(F)(2) - The RAUM computation excludes an amount retained for audit holdback provisions which allow the funds to retain a portion of a withdrawing investor's redemption proceeds for a period of time until the fund's annual audit is complete. Certain Voleon “fund of funds” invest in other Voleon managed “portfolio” funds; the assets of the portfolio funds are excluded from the calculation of assets for the fund of funds, and are therefore counted once in the RAUM computation. The RAUM computation includes the assets of cash and/or money market funds held by the Voleon fund of funds.  Item 6(A) – The firm recommends investments subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”); the firm is a registered “commodity pool operator.”   Item 6(B)(1) – The firm’s business is to provide investment advisory services. As described in the Funds’ offering documents and Form ADV Part 2A, certain intellectual property licensed by the firm is owned by an affiliated holding company (the “IP Company”).

Item 7(A) - Voleon has shared servicing arrangements in place with other non-financial affiliates in which personnel of such affiliates provide certain services in connection with Voleon’s operations. Data and answers for Voleon Securities LLC are as of February 4, 2025, the date the affiliate was registered with the SEC to operate as a broker-dealer.  Section 7.B.(1)(9) of Schedule D – We have reported on the basis that Voleon’s funds do not have cash exposure to covered securities; however, certain of Voleon’s funds may have indirect exposure through derivatives.  Section 7.B.(1)(11) of Schedule D – Gross assets per financial statement. The balance of certain Voleon fund of funds assets are invested in other internally managed funds. The gross asset value for these Voleon fund of funds excludes each fund’s investment in other internally Voleon managed funds. Additionally, certain funds report the cash and/or money that is held per the financial statements.  Section 7.B.(1)(13) of Schedule D – The approximate number of the private fund’s beneficial owners for Voleon Composition Holdings Fund, LP includes the investment of certain other Voleon funds that are not in the master-feeder arrangement.

1993982,"SCHEDULE B: For federal income taxes purposes Davenport & Company LLC (the “LLC”) is organized as a limited liability company that is owned by five corporations that have elected to be taxed as S Corporations.  The multiple S Corporations are required due to tax law limitations on the number of permitted shareholders per each S Corporation.  Davenport's Schedule A lists the following five S corporations as direct owners: DAVENPORT & CO. OF VIRGINIA, INC; DAVENPORT CORP;  DAVA CORP; DAVENPORT IV, INC.; AND DAVENPORT FIVE, INC.  While this structure results in 5 direct owners of the membership units of the LLC; the only beneficial owners of the LLC are the shareholders of the S Corporations, all of whom are employees of the LLC.  For voting purposes, each individual shareholder of one of the S Corporation votes his or her shares on any matters with his or her S Corporation which in turn are relayed to the LLC without alteration.  Since the number of LLC membership units exactly equals the aggregate number of outstanding S Corporation shares, each vote by an S Corporation share is also an identical vote by a membership unit in the LLC.  Accordingly, it is our view that when calculating ownership percentages, we look to the ownership percentages of the beneficial owners of the S Corporations in the aggregate.  Thus, while an individual holding shares in a single S Corporation may own 10% of that S Corporation's shares, that same individual may have only 1% of the beneficial ownership of the membership units in the LLC. No individual employee indirectly holds more than 10% of membership interest of the firm.  SCHEDULE D, SECTION 7.B: DAVENPORT HAS CERTAIN RELATED PERSONS WHO ARE ALSO GENERAL PARTNERS OF FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NOT LISTED ON SECTION 7.B OF SCHEDULE D.

A complete list of omitted affiliates will be provided upon request.  Section 1.F. – Schedule D Post operates without additional office locations, utilizing a hybrid work model that generally requires in-office attendance Tuesday through Thursday. Certain employees work remotely full-time.  Section 7.B.(1) – Schedule D Post has revised Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), to separately identify each Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) and Private Pooled Investment Vehicle. The gross asset value of each entity reflects the full regulatory assets under management attributable to each fund, but for the avoidance of doubt, the value of a Private Pooled Investment Vehicle into a CLO is only counted once for purposes of responses regarding regulatory assets under management in Item 5. The reported gross asset value for each entity represents its total RAUM. For Post CLOs, as Collateral Manager to Collateralized Loan Obligation (“CLO”) Funds, in most instances Post does not have access to current/specific information regarding the underlying investors in the CLOs. As a result, when answering questions 13, 14, 15 and 16 for CLOs, Post’s determination of beneficial ownership is based on the holders of the equity class (i.e., subordinated notes) of offered notes."

The FLP clients do not incur separate management fees.  Likewise, the Registrant may allocate a portion of the managed assets of certain clients to the private funds also managed by the Registrant (the “Funds”).

1992695,"General. Registrant currently provides investment management/advisory services to: (1) investment vehicles organized as legal entities (“GCM Investment Vehicles”); (2) accounts of non-fund clients (“GCM Managed Accounts” and, together with the GCM Investment Vehicles, the “GCM Funds”); and (3) certain institutional investors.    Item 5.B(2). GRV Securities LLC (“GSLLC”), an affiliate of Registrant, is a U.S.-registered broker-dealer. Certain employees of Registrant are registered representatives of GSLLC. GSLLC serves as placement agent or distributor for, among others, certain GCM Investment Vehicles. Registrant compensates GSLLC for serving as such placement agent or distributor on an annual flat fee basis.    Item 5.F(2) - Reflects Registrant’s regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) after adjusting for investments by some GCM Funds in other GCM Funds in order to avoid double counting Registrant’s RAUM. In certain cases where Registrant has been granted discretionary investment authority over GCM Funds, the investors/participants in those GCM Funds have informally reserved the right to approve or disapprove Registrant’s investment decisions for those GCM Funds prior to the implementation of such decisions.    Item 7 - Registrant’s investment management/advisory clients consist of: the GCM Investment Vehicles, holders of GCM Managed Accounts and certain institutional investors. Investors in the GCM Investment Vehicles are not, in their capacity as such, clients of Registrant. Accordingly, except as described below, although Registrant and its affiliated broker-dealers solicit prospective investors to invest in GCM Funds for which Registrant or an affiliate of Registrant is a general partner or investment manager, Registrant and its affiliated broker-dealers do not solicit Registrant’s clients to invest in GCM Funds for which Registrant or an affiliate of Registrant is a general partner or investment manager. Registrant may from time to time cause a GCM Fund to invest (or recommend that a GCM Funds invest) all or any portion of its assets in another GCM Fund, provided, among other things, that such investments have been adequately disclosed to participants in the GCM Funds involved, if such disclosure is material under the particular facts and circumstances, or, alternatively, if such investments are made on a basis that does not involve the payment of two levels of fees to Registrant. In addition, GCM Investments Japan K.K. (“GCM Japan”), a Japanese limited liability stock company of which Registrant is the sole shareholder, is registered as a securities company in Japan with the Kanto Local Finance Bureau. GCM Japan may act as a discretionary investment manager on behalf of its clients in Japan and, in that connection, may allocate its client assets to one or more GCM Funds.    Item 8.g(1). Registrant does not separately compensate financial intermediaries for the provision of non-execution related services and Registrant does not believe that it “pays up” for such services. However, Registrant may from time to time use financial intermediaries that provide research-related products or services to most or all of their customers, and - although Registrant does not request research-related products or services from such financial intermediaries - Registrant may on occasion receive and use research provided by such intermediaries. GCM Grosvenor may receive complimentary or discounted use of third-party cash management software from banking institutions in exchange for maintaining cash deposits or cash-equivalent investments (e.g., money market accounts) with such institutions, resulting in a potential conflict of interest when determining where to make such deposits or investments.    Item 9 - Master and feeder funds with different general partners will report AUM at the feeder fund level and will individually count each fund in the structure in sections 9.A and 9.B respectively.    Item 9.B.2 - RAUM data and information set forth in responses for Registrant’s Funds investing in private equity, infrastructure, and real estate are based, in part, on the most recent value of investments reported by the managers of such investments, adjusted for cash flows, where applicable. Co-investment data is based on the 9/30/24 fair value, which is the most recent fair value available to the Registrant, adjusted for cash flows, where applicable. Foreign-denominated funds are converted to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect as of 12/31/24. Schedule D Section 7.B.1.26 - the Registrant has engaged third party service providers to support the fund accounting and administration functions of the Registrant for certain of the Registrant’s private investment funds.   Schedule D Section 7.B. - Given the publicly available nature of the Form ADV, it is our reasonable belief that the Adviser and its clients would suffer substantial, irreparable business and reputational harm, upon a disclosure of the sub-advisers to Belmont Harbor Master Fund, L.P. that are unaffiliated with the Adviser, due to the highly sensitive confidential trade secrets and intellectual property associated with that commercial information.

WE HAVE CREATED THE CONSOLIDATING MASTER FUNDS, ALONG WITH NUMEROUS OTHER SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLES, TO FACILITATE INVESTMENTS IN SPECIFIC REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND OTHER FUND INVESTMENT HOLDINGS AND TO CONSOLIDATE CAPITAL FROM THE APPLICABLE ""FEEDER FUND"" PARTNERSHIPS. FOR EXAMPLE, INDIVIDUAL LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES OR LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS WILL TYPICALLY BE ESTABLISHED TO HOLD UNDERLYING REAL ESTATE ASSETS ON BEHALF OF OUR POOLED FUND CLIENTS (""PROPERTY SPVS""). WE FEEL THAT THE QUESTIONING OF ITEM 7.B GENERALLY REQUIRES DISCUSSION OF THE CONSOLIDATING MASTER FUNDS, BUT GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE FULL DISCLOSURE OF ALL PROPERTY SPVS AND SIMILARLY SITUATED ENTITIES (WHICH ARE NUMEROUS AND WHICH GENERALLY HOLD REAL ESTATE, NOT SECURITIES). IN RESPONSE TO SCHEDULE D, SECTION 7.B.(1).A., QUESTION 23, WHILE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE CONSOLIDATING MASTER FUNDS AND PROPERTY SPVS ARE NOT AUDITED BY AN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT (OR, IF THEY ARE AUDITED, THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT DELIVERED TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF THESE ENTITIES), THE ASSETS OF THESE ENTITIES ARE CONSIDERED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AUDITS OF THE APPLICABLE ""FEEDER FUND"" PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED TO INVESTORS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CUSTODY RULE."

1992643,"Item 2.C. - Notice filings are provided to Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Colorado due to the remote work status of certain employees of the Adviser.  Item 5.D. – The Adviser serves as investment adviser to 21 private investment funds; however, 7 of these funds have a single insurance company investor.  In accordance with the Staff’s FAQs on Item 5.D. of Form ADV (posted June 12, 2017), the Adviser has included the insurance company investor for these 7 single-investor funds in row (k).  The other private investment funds are reflected in row (f) because they are not single-investor funds. The Adviser serves as collateral manager for six collateralized loan obligation private funds. A newly formed fund, 720 East CLO VII, LTD., is in warehouse phase as of December 31, 2024, but the placement agent expects to launch this fund on March 31, 2025. Accordingly, we included this fund in our regulatory assets under management and client total.  Item 5.F.(2) – The Adviser’s clients consist primarily of its parent, The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (“Northwestern Mutual”), and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Northwestern Mutual enterprise.  As of December 31, 2024, these entities represented approximately $293.5billion of the Adviser’s $299.9billion of regulatory assets under management.   Northwestern Mutual owns interests in certain private investment funds for which NMIMC serves as investment adviser and collateral manager.  In accordance with the instructions for Part 1A, the value of these interests has been included in the assets NMIMC manages on behalf of Northwestern Mutual and in the applicable private funds.     Item 9 - $293.2billion, which represents the amount of assets managed on behalf of Northwestern Mutual and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Northwestern Mutual enterprise, has been excluded from Item 9 in reliance on the SEC staff's position in a prior no-action letter.  See Cigna Capital Advisors, SEC No-Action Letter (September 30, 1985).  Additionally, as noted above with respect to Item 5.D., the Adviser serves as investment adviser to 15 private co-investment funds. For purposes of Item 5.D., in accordance with the Staff’s FAQ cited above, the Adviser has counted the insurance company investor in the single-investor funds as a client, and the funds as clients for the funds that have more than one investor. Certain of those private co-investment funds are audited annually by an independent public accountant and audited financials are distributed to those funds’ investors under Section 206(4)-2(b)(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. See the SEC Staff’s FAQs on the Custody Rule, Question VI.11.  The responses to Items 9A. and 9B. both include assets of the 15 private co-investment fund clients referred to above in relation to Item 5.D. With respect to Item 9.A., the general partner of 13 of the 15 private investment funds is a related person of NMIMC and, as indicated in response to Item 7.A., is a SPV that relies on NMIMC’s Form ADV registration in reliance on the staff’s no-action letter ABA Subcommittee of Private Investment Entities (December 8, 2005). With response to Item 9.B., NMIMC may be deemed to have custody of the assets of certain private co-investment fund clients due to the authority of its related person, Northwestern Mutual.      Schedule D, Section 7.A. - Certain related persons have been omitted from Section 7.A. of Schedule D because the Adviser (1) has no business dealings with such related persons in connection with advisory services it provides to clients, (2) does not conduct shared operations with such related persons, (3) does not refer clients or business to the related persons, and the related persons do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser, (4) does not share supervised persons or premises with the related persons and (5) has no reason to believe that its relationship with the related persons otherwise creates a conflict of interest with its clients.  A supplementary list of related persons that are in one or more of the categories listed in Section 7.A. will be provided upon request.  The foreign financial regulatory authorities identified in response to Schedule D, Section 7.A., Question 10.(b) for Northwestern Mutual refer to markets in which sub-custodian accounts are open and there is authority to trade in the local market.   720 East CLO 2022-I, LTD.; 720 East CLO 2023-I, LTD.; 720 East CLO 2023-II, LTD.; 720 East CLO IV, LTD.; 720 East CLO V, LTD.; 720 East CLO VI, LTD.; and 720 East CLO VII, LTD. Item 28 - We have endeavored to provide private fund reporting information as accurately as possible with respect to collateralized loan obligation vehicles, even where we feel certain questions are inapplicable or cannot be accurately responded to with the response options provided. For example, beneficial interests in securities issued by these collateralized loan obligation vehicles are traded through a depositary institution that does not provide the adviser with detail on identity or number of beneficial owners. Since questions 13, 15 and 16 in section 7.B(1) do not allow us to leave these items blank, we have responded with 'zero' ('0') but expressly disclaim the answers provided for these questions. In addition, the primary offering of a collateralized loan obligation vehicle is generally conducted through a placement agent, but the activities of the placement agent are not ongoing after the launch of the vehicle. As a result, in question 28 of section 7.B.(1), we have named the placement agent, for collateralized loan obligation vehicles when the primary offering occurred. .  Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) – The amounts listed for required minimum investment commitments reflect minimums set forth in each private fund’s Form D Notice of Sale of Securities.  Individual commitments of lesser amounts may be accepted at the discretion of the general partner for each fund.  In addition, with respect to the single investor funds described above, the number of beneficial owners for each fund includes a third-party investor, as well as a general partner entity affiliated with the Adviser. Northwestern Mutual Private Equity Co-Investment Fund IV, LP will be subject to an annual audit, however the investment period for this fund commenced on January 1, 2025, and Regulatory Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024, consisted solely of uncalled capital commitments. Accordingly, this fund did not have an annual audit for year ended December 31, 2024."

In addition, PMA RAUM excludes RAUM associated with other RICS/BDCS. For purposes of Section 5.K.(2) of this Schedule, the Registrant has excluded borrowings and gross notional exposure of derivatives attributable to separate accounts that are managed by third-party managers. Related persons of the Registrant that are SEC-registered investment advisers may be the adviser of private funds. These private funds may not be listed on Section 7.B of this Schedule D. Information on certain of these private funds is available on the Form ADV, Schedule D, Section 7.B of (I) Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (“GS&Co”), SEC Registration Number 801-16048; or (II) Goldman Sachs Asset Management International (“GSAMI”), SEC Registration Number 801-38157 which list certain of these private funds. The Registrant's advisory clients may be solicited to invest in some of the private funds. For certain private funds, the Registrant is not able to provide all information requested in Section 7.B of Schedule D as the Registrant does not have access to such information. For these private funds, the Registrant has provided information that was available to it. For certain private funds, the Registrant obtains information requested in Section 7.B of Schedule D from third parties without independent verification. For certain private funds, the manager may waive the minimum investment requirement at its discretion. For certain private funds, the minimum investment requirement may be provided in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For certain sub-advised foreign public funds, which are not primarily intended for U.S. investors, the Registrant has not treated such funds as private funds for purposes of Section 7.B of Schedule D. Items 9.A. and 9.B. Assume that the firm could be deemed to have custody of benefit responsive agreements issued by financial institutions to firm clients. Amounts have been reported at the book value of such benefit responsive contracts. In addition, we are an investment adviser for certain commingled funds administered by an affiliate. The affiliate is deemed under the federal securities laws to have custody of the cash and securities of the funds.  The Registrant serves as sub-adviser to investment companies where it provides investment supervision over the assets for which it acts as sub-adviser. The Registrant also provides non-discretionary advice to managers of investment companies and other investment funds and institutions. Registrant also provides investment advice through its model portfolios and asset allocation strategies to institutions, including investment advisers. Information about private funds that dissolved during the prior calendar year may not be included in this Form ADV except that such funds may be reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) solely in connection with the Registrant’s ability to report them on its Form PF. The Registrant has relationships with, may provide services to, and recommend the services of, affiliated entities in the Goldman Sachs Family. The particular services involved depend on the type of services offered by and/or needs of the affiliated entity. The arrangements may involve various compensation arrangements, including paying or sharing the compensation obligations of employees, and internal allocations of fees earned from clients, subject to the requirements of applicable law. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management business is supported by many Goldman Sachs employees who fulfill a number of different functions that are shared across the Registrant and multiple advisory affiliates. Approximately 3353 employees of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., the Registrant’s ultimate parent, provide services to the Registrant and its advisory affiliates but are not included in Item 5.A of this ADV. In the normal course of business, AM seeks to consolidate entities where possible to achieve efficient operations and provide better client service. These consolidations may result in significant changes to a registered advisors' RAUM along with other reportable details. The Registrant has related persons that are not listed on Section 7.A of this Schedule D that are the general partners of private pooled vehicles that are listed on the Form ADV, Schedule D, of certain of the Registrant’s related SEC-registered investment advisers.

We will operate a fully functional interactive website that exclusively provides digital investment advisory services on an ongoing basis to more than one client. This advice will be generated through software-based models and algorithms that are dynamically tailored to the personal information each client provides through our suitability questionnaire during onboarding.  Each client must complete a digital onboarding process that collects information about their financial situation, goals, risk tolerance, investment horizon, and level of sophistication. Based on this data, our algorithm generates personalized investment advice. Clients are also given the ability to impose reasonable restrictions on their portfolio (e.g., exclude certain sectors or instruments), which our models respect and apply when generating advice. These practices meet the SEC’s requirements for personalized fiduciary advice through a digital platform and are fully compliant with Rule¿203A-2(e).  Furthermore, to avoid triggering classification as an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, we operate our advisory services in compliance with Rule¿3a-4. Specifically:  (i) We collect client-specific information at account opening and provide mechanisms to impose or update reasonable investment restrictions.  (ii) We initiate annual reassessments and provide quarterly opportunities for clients to update their profile or investment restrictions, ensuring advice remains aligned with evolving financial goals.  (iii) Clients retain full ownership of their accounts, which are individually managed in their name at our custodian (Interactive Brokers). Accounts are not pooled or commingled.  We do not permit self-directed trading or client-initiated transactions through our platform. Our clients receive only model-generated advice via the interactive website; we do not offer newsletters, email advice, or advisory services outside the platform. Clients are required to execute an advisory agreement prior to receiving any investment advice.  If we fail to meet the conditions of Rule¿203A-2(e), including operation of an interactive website and provision of ongoing advice to more than one client, we will promptly withdraw our SEC registration."

Affiliates of the Company serve, and intend in the future to serve, as co-investors in joint ventures with unaffiliated investors where the latter maintain significant approval rights over the management of the joint ventures.  Such proprietary accounts and joint ventures are not securities and thus are not categorized as a Fund, are not included in Regulatory Assets under Management (“RAUM”) or reported in dollars in custody and are not considered “clients” for any purpose in the ADV Part 1.    //  GID considers its master-feeder structures to be one client and does not count the feeder funds as a separate client for the purpose of calculating responses to any question in this ADV.  //  In response to Item 6.B.(1), Other Business Activities, GID has answered ""no"" because the investment manager itself does not participate in any other business activities.  However, GID has affiliates that primarily provide services in the multifamily or industrial real estate business, including property management, property accounting, insurance services, construction and development management.  Additionally, GID's affiliates receive reimbursements related to various services provided as more fully discussed in the ADV Part 2A.  //  Certain funds make investments through splitters (""specialty vehicles"") that GID forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory or other reasons.  The specialty vehicles have not been separately reported in Section 7.A or 7.B of Schedule D, but any assets attributable to such specialty vehicles have been consolidated and reported with the fund to which they relate. A list of omitted entities will be provided to the SEC upon request.  //  In response to Item 8.E, GID has answered ""yes"" because it uses real estate brokers within the terms of its funds' governing documents.  Although the GID does not intend to regularly engage in public securities transactions, it reserves the right to distribute securities to investors in a fund or sell securities, including through using a broker-dealer, such as where a public trading market exists.   //  GID and its relying adviser have custody of pooled investment vehicle client assets because its related persons serve as the general partners of the pooled investment vehicles.  Cash and securities for which these related persons have custody are included in Item 9.B.  Further, Item 9.B excludes uncalled capital that is included in regulatory assets under management in Item 5.  //  GID has established special purpose vehicles (each an “SPV”) to act as the general partners of its private funds.  The SPVs have not registered with the Commission in reliance on the positions expressed in the ABA No-Action Letter dated December 8, 2005, and affirmed in the ABA No-Action Letter dated January 18, 2012.  //  With respect to Schedule B and Section 4.B of Schedule R, there are no 25% or greater economic owners of GID Multifamily Investment Management Holding LLC or GID Industrial Advisers Holding LLC to include on these schedules.  //  The following funds will undergo their first audit as of year-end 2025:  GID Industrial Tactical IRETI-A LP, GID Industrial Tactical IRETI-B LP, and GID PCS Venture LP.

Furthermore, certain of the responses contained herein, including responses to Items 5.B(6), 7.B, 8.A and 9, are limited to the Adviser’s clients that are U.S. persons.

1993901,"Given the nature of the private funds that we manage, several of which are private fund of funds, we provide unaudited regulatory assets under management, gross asset value, and custody values as our December 31 figures are typically not finalized or audited until April or June of the following calendar year. In Section 7.B.(1) Private Fund Reporting, it was noted that the Mei AGI Transpose Fund 1, L.P. and The Yes-Code Fund, L.P. are not currently subject to a separate annual financial statement audit pursuant to Rule 206(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the ""Custody Rule""). These funds are principally owned by certain other funds managed by Transpose (for purposes of this section, ""Certain Other Transpose Funds"") that are subject to an annual audit conducted by an independent public accountant registered with, and subject to inspection by, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (""PCAOB""). Such audited financial statements fully account for the assets and operations of the Mei AGI Transpose Fund 1, L.P. and The Yes-Code Fund, L.P. and are distributed to investors of Certain Other Transpose Funds within the timeframes required by the Custody Rule. This structure ensures that the ultimate beneficial owners of Certain Other Transpose Funds receive audited financial information that includes the assets of Mei AGI Transpose Fund 1, L.P. and The Yes-Code Fund, L.P., consistent with the investor protection objectives of the Custody Rule and SEC guidance regarding special purpose vehicles. Accordingly, a separate audit of Mei AGI Transpose Fund 1, L.P. and The Yes-Code Fund, L.P. is not required at this time."
1993905,"**Regarding Items 5.A. and 5.B. (Employees), the Adviser is party to an arrangement with ACON Investments, L.L.C. (“ACON Investments”), pursuant to which ACON Investments provides the services of various private equity fund investment, finance, accounting, tax, legal, ESG, investor relations, compliance and support professionals to the Adviser. Most of the employees and independent contractors that work with ACON are not engaged by the Adviser directly. The Adviser’s answers to Items 5.A. and 5.B.(1) reflect the number of employees and independent contractors of ACON Investments who perform work, pursuant to this arrangement, for the Adviser (i.e., as if for purposes of this Item 5, the Adviser, instead of ACON Investments, has engaged such persons directly). **Regarding Items 5.D.(3) (Clients), 5.F. (Regulatory Assets Under Management) and 9.B.(2) (Custody), the Adviser uses the same methodology for reporting its regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) in both Part 1A and 2A of the Form ADV. Instructions for Item 5.F. of Part 1A of the Form ADV provide that, in determining the amount of a registered adviser’s RAUM, an adviser should “include the entire value of each securities portfolio for which [it] provide[s] continuous and regular supervisory or management services.” The Adviser provides management services to one or more Investment Vehicles (as defined in the Brochure) advised by affiliates of the Adviser. In some cases, an Investment Vehicle will aggregate certain investors’ interests alongside a particular Investment Vehicle’s share of invested capital in respect of such portfolio investment. In reporting RAUM, ACON eliminates double counting of assets in such situations where an ACON Investment Vehicle invests in another Investment Vehicle. The total amount of RAUM reported in Item 5.F.(2)(c) therefore will equal the total amount reported in Item 5.D.(3). Instructions for Item 9.B.(2) of Part 1A of the Form ADV provide that, we shall include “the approximate amount of client funds and securities and total number of clients for which your related persons have custody.” The Adviser and its related persons reported in Item 7.A. have custody of all the client funds and securities reported in Item 5.D.(3). **To calculate RAUM for purposes of the response to Item 5.F.(2), the Adviser has included each account’s (i) fair value, (ii) cash and other assets and (iii) any unfunded capital (which includes uncalled capital commitments and recyclable capital). **In the responses to Item 7.B. (Private Fund Reporting) on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), Question A.11. for each of the Adviser’s private funds, the calculation of “gross asset value” includes all assets that are included in the private fund’s calculation of “regulatory assets under management,” including the amount of uncalled capital commitments. The sum of the gross asset values listed in aggregate for each of the Adviser’s private fund clients will exceed the RAUM calculation listed in Item 5.F.(2), because “gross asset value” on a fund-by-fund basis will not exclude portions of other private funds to eliminate “double counting.” **Certain of the Adviser’s related persons listed in Item 7.A. (Financial Industry Affiliations) on Schedule D, Section 7.A. are special purpose vehicles formed to act as the general partners or managing members of certain of the Adviser’s private fund clients. In reliance on the SEC Staff’s No Action Letter to the American Bar Association dated January 18, 2012, such related persons will be covered by the Adviser’s registration and deemed to be registered by the SEC."

With respect to question 1.F, the principal office and place of business of the Filing Adviser is located at the Filing Adviser’s U.S. address located at 399 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10022. The Filing Adviser has two investment management and administrative offices that direct the business of the Filing Adviser which are located in New York and London. Additionally, there are two branch offices: one is located in Florida and was established in June 2018 and the second is located in Boston and was established in January 2025.   The Filing Adviser and each Relying Adviser, except for TFG Asset Management UK LLP, are ultimately controlled by the Filing Adviser's general partner, TFG Asset Management GP Ltd.

As long as the Filing Adviser is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, each Relying Adviser will conduct its investment advisory activities as if it were itself so registered. In addition, the Filing Adviser has an affiliated registered investment adviser, Tetragon Financial Management LP (""TFM""), which has related persons that are not listed in Section 7.A of Schedule D. Information about Tetragon is available in the Form ADV of TFM. Tetragon, a client of TFM, may invest in private funds managed by certain of the Relying Advisers and Affiliated Adviser. Such investments have been included in the relevant calculations for purposes of answering questions 14, but excluded for purposes of answering questions 19 and 20 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D as they are made by a client of another registered investment adviser. Clients that act as ""feeder funds"" are disregarded for purposes of answering questions 14, 19 and 20 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D.

Additionally, with respect to question 28 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, CLOs typically pay placement fees in connection with their establishment. The assets under management and custody figures reported in Item 5 and Item 9, respectively are as of December 31, 2024 except for Tetragon Credit Income V L.P.

With respect to question 11 of Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D, gross asset figures reported are as of December 31, 2024 except for (i) Tetragon Credit Income V L.P. (and associated feeder funds) where figures are reported as of its first close which occurred on February 21, 2025.

Furthermore, with respect to Tetragon Credit Income IV L.P. (""TCI IV”), the assets of the fund are held in the investment series of TCI IV LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of TCI IV and in the retention series of each of Flatiron RR LLC and Elmwood RR CLO LLC, in which TCI IV is a member and controls the activities of the respective Retention Series of such entities.

(and its associated feeder funds) have not yet been audited or its assets valued by a third-party since the fund did not launch until February 2025 and is in its initial fiscal year as of the date of this filing. Pending any changes in circumstances, Tetragon Credit Income V L.P. (and its associated feeder funds) will be audited, and its assets valued by a third-party in 2025.   Please note – With respect to answering Item 5.F.(2)(b), the amount of Non-Discretionary Regulatory Assets Under Management (""Non-Discretionary RAUM"")  is 0, however, in order to submit this Annual Amendment as indicated by the IARD system, we had to enter an amount of Non-Discretionary RAUM that exceeded our number of non-discretionary accounts. Since we have 6 non-discretionary accounts/clients, we entered an amount of $7.00 in response to this question in order for the IARD system to allow us to submit the filing. The correct amount of RAUM for our 6 non-discretionary clients is 0. Furthermore, we also had to enter $7.00 in response to Item 5.D.(3)(n) although the correct amount is 0 in order for the total RAUM figure provided in Item 5.F.(2)(c) to match the sum of RAUM amounts provided for Item 5.D.(3)."

Investment Grade Corporate Bonds include corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of BBB or higher and a Moody’s rating of Baa or higher. Corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of below BBB or a Moody’s rating below Baa are categorized as Non-Investment Grade Corporate Bonds.  Those securities given opposing ratings by Moody’s and S&P (investment-grade and non-investment grade) automatically default to the non-investment grade category.  3.

For the purposes of Item 1.B, general partners of each Private Fund disclosed in Item 7.B.(1) rely upon the registration of FIAM LLC (the “Adviser”) and, consistent with the existing SEC staff position with respect to special purpose vehicles created to act as a private fund’s general partner or managing member, are not reported on Schedule R.

ITEM 7.A.  Pursuant to and as permitted by the instructions for Form ADV, we have not completed a Schedule D Section 7.A. for parties that serve as sponsor, general partner, managing member (or equivalent) of pooled investment vehicles managed by L Catterton Asia Advisors or L Catterton Europe SAS.  Information about those entities is included in Form ADV’s otherwise filed for L Catterton Asia Advisors and L Catterton Europe SAS.    ITEM 7.B.(1).  Pursuant to authority under the organizational documents for each of the L Catterton Funds, alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) have been created as structuring vehicles for particular investments made by certain of the L Catterton Funds to address various tax, regulatory or other similar concerns.  Where an AIV has been created, limited partners in the L Catterton Funds have not made a new investment decision to invest through the AIV because each of the AIVs is structured to (i) have the ability to call capital up to the then remaining capital commitments of the applicable fund entity and (ii) have the same pool of investors investing through the applicable fund entity.  Further, for custody rule purposes, AIVs created in relation to any particular L Catterton Fund are combined in the audited financial statements prepared for the applicable L Catterton Fund.  For these reasons, the AIVs have not been separately reported on Form ADV but rather aggregated with the applicable Catterton Fund for ADV reporting purposes only (e.g. adding together the applicable L Catterton Fund and related AIVs for purposes of, among other things, reporting gross assets of, and number of investors in, the L Catterton Fund).  We believe this aggregation alleviates confusion relating to the fund family capital commitments and number of investors.  ITEM 7.B.(1).  For a variety of legal, tax, regulatory or other similar purposes, L Catterton may utilize special purpose vehicles to facilitate investments in certain securities by one or more pooled investment vehicles that L Catterton manages (""Investment SPVs"").  These Investment SPVs generally share the characteristics of Investment SPVs as described in IM Guidance Update No. 2014-07.  For purposes of this Form ADV, L Catterton has characterized these Investment SPVs as Other Private Funds.  ITEM 9.A(2). The amount of client funds and securities for which the registrant is deemed to have custody as disclosed in Item 9.A.(2) is calculated based on the fair value of portfolio investments as of December 31, 2024, plus cash on hand and other assets as of December 31, 2024.

AMG also holds equity interests in certain other investment advisers (“AMG Affiliates”). Each of the AMG Affiliates, including Parnassus, operates autonomously and independently of AMG and of each other. Except as described in this Form ADV, Parnassus does not have any business dealings with these AMG Affiliates and does not conduct any joint operations with them. Parnassus carries out its asset management activity, including the exercise of investment discretion and voting rights, independent of the AMG Affiliates. The AMG Affiliates do not formulate advice for Parnassus’ clients and do not, in Parnassus’ view, present any potential conflict of interest with Parnassus’ clients. In accordance with the instructions to Item 7, individual information on each AMG Affiliate is not listed in Section 7.A. of Schedule D of Part 1A of Form ADV unless Parnassus has business dealings with certain AMG Affiliates. A list of all AMG Affiliates is available to Parnassus’ clients upon request. Parnassus is party to a client service/marketing agreement with AMG Funds LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG, and AMG Distributors, Inc. (together, with AMG Funds LLC, the “U.S. AMG Subsidiaries”), a limited purpose broker-dealer that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG Funds, LLC.  Under that client service/marketing agreement, the U.S. AMG Subsidiaries market Parnassus' investment management services and the Parnassus Funds, as appropriate, to unaffiliated third-party intermediaries that actively target North American institutional, family office and sub-advisory clients. The U.S. AMG Subsidiaries may also provide client services to clients retained under the agreement, upon request by Parnassus. Parnassus pays the U.S. AMG Subsidiaries a fee for these services.  Parnassus is a party to a client service/marketing agreement with various non-U.S. subsidiaries of AMG (collectively, the “Non-U.S. AMG Subsidiaries”) under which the Non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries introduce Parnassus' investment management services, as appropriate, to prospective institutional clients and/or provide institutional client services to certain of Parnassus’ clients in various foreign jurisdictions. Parnassus pays the Non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries a fee for these services. The Non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries are not broker-dealers, investment advisers, or any of the other financial institutions described in Item 7.A or Form ADV Part 1A. The Non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries may be registered or exempt from registration, as appropriate, with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authorities."
1985390,"Re Item 5.D, Item 5.F and Section 7.B.1  The TP Fund L.P. (“TP Fund”) invests substantially all of its respective assets in other Taconic funds.  Therefore, we have not included TP Fund’s investments in such funds in computing assets for Item 5.D, Item 5.F and 7.B.1 because such inclusion would result in double counting of assets.   Re Item 5.E.  As of April 1, 2025, Taconic will receive a consulting fee from another adviser in respect of a fund formerly managed by Taconic for which Taconic continues to provide non-advisory consulting services.    Re Section 7.B.1: (1)   Taconic Capital Advisors L.P. (“TCA LP”), the filing adviser, and Taconic Capital Advisors UK LLP (“TCAUK”) (a “Relying Adviser”), are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance upon guidance from the SEC and the Form ADV instructions.   TCA LP has listed TCAUK as a relying adviser in Schedule R of this Form ADV.  All Funds for which TCAUK serves as subadvisor are listed in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D of this Form ADV.  TCAUK is authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom.  On January 1, 2008, Taconic Opportunity Offshore Fund Ltd. began conducting all of its investment and trading activities through Taconic Opportunity Master Fund L.P. (“TOMF”).   On July 1, 2013, Taconic Opportunity Fund L.P., began conducting a substantial portion of its respective investment operations indirectly via an investment in TOMF.  In addition, Taconic Opportunity Offshore Fund Ltd. began investing in TOMF indirectly through Taconic Opportunity Offshore Intermediate Fund L.P.     Taconic European Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund II L.P. and Taconic European Credit Dislocation Fund II L.P. conduct all of their investment and trading activities directly through an investment in Taconic European Credit Dislocation Master Fund II L.P.  Accordingly, substantially all of the assets of each Master Fund identified in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are those of the corresponding feeder funds.  Taconic European Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund III L.P. and Taconic European Credit Dislocation Fund III L.P. conduct all of their investment and trading activities directly through an investment in Taconic European Credit Dislocation Master Fund III L.P.  Accordingly, substantially all of the assets of each Master Fund identified in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are those of the corresponding feeder funds.  Taconic European Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund IV L.P. and Taconic European Credit Dislocation Fund IV  L.P. conduct all of their investment and trading activities directly through an investment in Taconic European Credit Dislocation Master Fund III L.P.  Accordingly, substantially all of the assets of each Master Fund identified in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D are those of the corresponding feeder funds. All the feeder funds’ prime brokers and custodians are listed in Section 7.B.1 of Schedule D. Each master-feeder arrangement is reported using a single Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) unless otherwise noted.    The TP Fund invests substantially all of its respective assets in other Taconic funds.    Taconic Market Dislocation Master Fund III (Cayman) L.P. is a master fund of a master-feeder arrangement.  Taconic Market Dislocation Fund III AIV I (Cayman) L.P is a master fund of a master-feeder arrangement.  Taconic Market Dislocation Onshore Fund III L.P. and Taconic Market Dislocation Fund (Cayman) III L.P. (each, a “feeder fund”, and together, the “feeder funds”) invest in Taconic Market Dislocation Master Fund III (Cayman) L.P.  and Taconic Market Dislocation Fund III AIV I (Cayman) L.P. (each, a “master fund”, and together, the “master funds”). Given that the feeder funds invest in two separate master funds, each feeder fund is reported separately in Section 7.B.1.  We have not included the feeder funds’ investments in such master funds in computing assets for Item 5.D, Item 5.F and 7.B.1 because such inclusion would result in double counting of assets.    Taconic Credit Dislocation Fund IV L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and Taconic Credit Dislocation Offshore Fund IV L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, both of which invest using a master-feeder structure through Taconic Credit Dislocation Master Fund IV L.P. (the “CDF Master Fund IV”) and Taconic Credit Dislocation Fund IV AIV I L.P. (each, a “master fund”, and together, the “master funds”). Given that the feeder funds invest in two separate master funds, each feeder fund is reported separately in Section 7.B.1. We have not included the feeder funds’ investments in such master funds in computing assets for Item 5.D, Item 5.F and 7.B.1 because such inclusion would result in double counting of assets.    Taconic Merger Arbitrage Master Fund L.P. is a master fund of a master-feeder arrangement.  Taconic Merger Arbitrage Fund L.P. and Taconic Merger Arbitrage Offshore Fund Ltd. invest in the Taconic Merger Arbitrage Master Fund L.P.    The total regulatory assets under management numbers are as of December 31, 2024.  All the funds’ gross asset values in question 11 of Section 7.B.1 are also as of December 31, 2024.   Re Section 7.B.(1)(7)(d):  As of April 1, 2025, Tammy Jennissen replaced Sherri Fleming as the director of the Taconic Opportunity Offshore Fund Ltd. and Taconic Merger Arbitrage Offshore Fund Ltd.  Re Schedule A:   Schedule A requires the full legal name (first, middle and last name) of each executive officer and direct owner.  Flaurine St Louis does not have a middle name.  As such, there is no middle name listed in Schedule A for Flaurine St Louis."

Specifically, we are wholly-owned by Legal & General Investment Management United States (Holdings) Inc.

These three entities can not be adequately described in the selections available in Item 7A.   Item 9 (Custody) – As disclosed in Item 9A, L&G – Asset Management, America (“LGIMA”) is the managing member of 18 Private Funds. In this capacity, LGIMA has legal access to the Private Funds’ securities and funds in a manner that results in us being deemed to have “custody”. LGIMA does not have physical custody of the Private Funds assets. Neither LGIMA, nor any of its related persons are qualified custodians. As such, LGIMA’s response to Item 9F should reflect zero. Due to the affirmative response in Item 9A, a non-zero response is required by Form ADV. As noted in Schedule D, Northern Trust Securities is the qualified custodian over all Private Fund accounts denoted in Item 9A (2). The ‘1’ in the response is representative of Northern Trust Securities.   For purposes of LGIM America’s Form ADV Part 1, RAUM is calculated on a gross basis (without deduction of any outstanding indebtedness or other accrued but unpaid liabilities) and double counts investments by one investment product into another (e.g., internal fund-of-funds structures).

1993384,"Crestline Investors, Inc., is the general partner of Crestline Management, L.P. (the ""Filing Adviser""). In addition, our management structure includes Crestline Canada, Inc. and Crestline Canada Sub, L.P. (each a “Relying Adviser”). Each Relying Adviser will conduct its investment advisory activities in accordance with the Investments Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the policies and procedures of the Filing Adviser, and each Relying Adviser's employees and activities will be subject to the Filing Adviser's supervision and control. The Crestline Canada entities have their principal place of business in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The Crestline Canada entities are owned as set forth in the Filing Adviser’s brochure. Thru line, L.P., a limited partner in the Filing Adviser and an affiliated general partner holding company, does not have a management function or control of the Filing Adviser. As such, Thru Line, L.P. is not listed on Schedule A as a Control Person. Crestline Europe, LLP is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and is a Participating Affiliate.  Bratton Capital Management, L.P. is also a Relying Adviser; it and Bratton Capital, Inc. are related persons of Filing Adviser and serve as general partners to or manage limited partnerships that are not listed in response to section 7.B.(2). of this Schedule D because they are special purpose vehicles for family office investments managed by Bratton Capital Management, L.P. (as opposed to investment vehicles offered by the Filing Adviser). The Filing Adviser agrees to provide a list of such limited partnerships and their general partners upon request.  Crestline Associates Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of the Filing Adviser, has an indirect ownership interest in Crestline Denali Capital, LLC (“Denali”). As such, principal owners of the Filing Adviser have an indirect ownership interest in Denali. The Filing Adviser has direct and indirect ownership interests of SummitTX Capital, L.P.

Investment funds were added to or removed from Schedule 7.B.(1) if they were launched or closed in 2024. The stated minimum investment amounts may be lower for certain investors. The Reporting Funds Crestline Opportunity Fund III (Europe) Master Fund D SCSP, Crestline Opportunity IV Master Fund, L.P., Crestline Opportunity Fund V Master Fund, L.P. and Crestline StepStone Opportunistic Credit Master Fund I, L.P. are each part of fund structures where there are multiple ""Master"" funds to various ""Feeder"" funds. Capital commitments from investors into those ""Feeder"" funds can ultimately be invested into any of the Master Funds within the respective Master-Feeder structure, depending on the characteristics of the underlying investments. Since we do not expect these ""Feeder” funds to invest substantially all of their assets into any of the “Master” funds, we do not characterize the relationship as a Master-Feeder relationship per Form ADV instructions. In each case, when we commence reporting of performance to investors, we will report an aggregate return to investors based on the consolidated performance of all of the related master funds. We believe this approach better reflects how investors view the investment (i.e., as an investment into one fund based on one capital commitment rather than an investment into multiple funds).  Each of CL Commonwealth, Inc. and CL Trading, L.P. is an SPV which we treat as a fund due to the SEC’s guidance on application of the custody rule to SPVs which include managed accounts as investors in the SPVs.  Aggregate returns are reported to the investors in the funds or managed accounts comprising the investors in these SPVs, but separate returns by investment are not reported.  Crestline Menlo Fund, L.P., Crestline Offshore Menlo Fund, L.P., Crestline Recovery Fund II, L.P., Crestline Recovery Fund III, L.P., and CL Recovery Trading Fund III, L.P. have taken certain corporate actions to facilitate the sale or liquidation of certain positions in connection with their winding down.  Due to some of the structuring changes, the Reporting Funds Crestline Menlo Fund, L.P., Crestline Offshore Menlo Fund, L.P., and Crestline Recovery Fund III, L.P. are now “Master” funds. For funds launched in 2024 we answer “yes” to question 23(g) in schedule 7.B.(1) as it is expected audited financial statements will be distributed to the respective private funds’ investors for the fiscal year.

In lieu of a surprise examination referenced in Item 9.C. of Form ADV Part 1A, the Registrant will adhere to the safeguards outlined in the above-referenced no-action guidance.

1977640,"Oaktree’s asset management business is indirectly controlled by Brookfield Oaktree Holdings, LLC (“BOH”) (which changed its name on March 15, 2024, from Oaktree Capital Group, LLC) and Oaktree Capital Holdings, LLC (“OCH”) (which changed its name on March 15, 2024, from Atlas OCM Holdings, LLC).  A majority of Oaktree’s business is owned by Brookfield Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. (collectively, “Brookfield”) and the remainder is owned by current and former Oaktree executives and employees, and certain related individuals and entities.  Brookfield’s ownership interest in Oaktree’s business is held through BOH, OCH and related entities. Brookfield and Oaktree operate their respective investment businesses largely independently, with each operating under its own brand and led by its existing management and investment teams, and Oaktree and Brookfield generally managing their investment operations independently of each other subject to an information barrier between the firms. Oaktree does not consider Brookfield or its affiliates to be its “advisory affiliates” or “related persons” for purposes of this Form ADV. For more information regarding Brookfield and its affiliates, please refer to the Form ADV of Brookfield affiliated investment advisers: Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC (CRD# 110497), Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Credit), LLC (CRD# 170811), Brookfield Asset Management PIC U.S. LLC (CRD# 151599), Brookfield Asset Management PIC BMG, LLC. (CRD# 312797), Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Advisor LLC (CRD# 312792) and, Brookfield BHS Advisors LLC (CRD# 309500). Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. (“OCGH”) holds 100% of the Class B units of OCH which, during the period (the “Initial Period”, which is more specifically described in the Form 8-K filed October 4, 2019, available through EDGAR) from September 30, 2019 through the date on which Brookfield delivers a written election to end the Initial Period (which election cannot be delivered before September 30, 2026 unless certain events occur before then), entitle OCGH to 10 votes per Class B unit on all matters to be submitted to a vote of the OCH members. In addition, during the Initial Period, the board of directors of OCH is comprised of two individuals selected by OCGH, two selected by Brookfield, and the remaining directors nominated by OCGH and subject to joint written appointment by each of OCGH and Brookfield. As a result, during the Initial Period, OCGH controls OCH and, indirectly, the Registrant, although OCH is prohibited from taking certain actions without the consent of Brookfield. The General Partner of the Limited Partnerships listed in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has the authority to waive the minimum investment requirement. Some of the Limited Partnerships for which the Registrant acts as General Partner or Investment Adviser are closed-end limited partnerships. As such, clients are not solicited to invest in such closed-end limited partnerships after the final closing has occurred. We have excluded from our disclosure limited partnerships and/or limited liability companies organized and operated solely for the benefit of our employees as well as any special purpose vehicles that were formed in relation to a specific investment or private fund. For certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) of schedule D that are denominated in Euro, the Gross Asset Value and minimum investment commitment values have been converted to USD for purposes of reporting. For all private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value has been rounded to the nearest thousands. For purposes of Item 5: Information About Your Advisory Business – Regulatory Assets Under Management, Oaktree advises certain funds of funds that invest solely in other private funds advised by Oaktree, as noted in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. for purposes of calculating Regulatory Assets Under Management as reported in Item 5 and reporting of the Gross Asset Value of private funds in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the limited partner interests held in the other Oaktree private funds by the funds of funds have been excluded from the Gross Asset Values of such funds of funds. As such, the Gross Asset Value of such funds of funds may be reported as zero in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), if such funds of funds have no other assets other than the limited partner interests in the other Oaktree private funds. In addition, feeder funds are consolidated with the main fund to which they relate for purposes of financial statement reporting. Therefore, for purposes of reporting Gross Asset Values for feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value for the feeder fund is included in Gross Asset Value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. For purposes of calculating the gross asset values in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), any uncalled commitment amounts are not included for each relevant private fund. For purposes of reporting beneficial owners, for the feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the number of beneficial owners for the feeder fund is included in the beneficial owner value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. All funds with financial statements subject to an annual audit, listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), are audited by the same overarching auditing firm; however, in circumstances where the main fund and feeder fund are audited by entities of such auditing firm in separate jurisdictions, the specific entity auditing the feeder is not separately disclosed. The General Partner of certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) may make an investment through an Oaktree or Oaktree affiliate-managed Alternative Investment Vehicle (""AIV""). Each AIV is governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially similar to those of the fund to which they relate. Investments made through the AIVs are funded by contributions either directly to these entities or contributions to the funds to which they relate that are subsequently transferred to the AIV, such that in both cases investors will directly own a limited partnership interest in the AIV. Financial results for each AIV are reported on a consolidated basis with the fund to which they relate. For certain private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) that are securitized asset funds, senior noteholders are treated as creditors while the income noteholders (who possess an equity-like claim on fund assets) are treated as beneficial owners of the fund for purposes of Ownership questions 13-16. In addition, for certain securitized asset funds, registrant has responded “No” to questions 23(G) and (H) due to the fact that such private funds do not obtain unaudited financial statements and thus the questions are not applicable. For certain master funds included in Section 7.B.(1) that are part of master-feeder arrangements, we do not solicit clients to invest at the master fund level and therefore have answered “No” for Question A.19 of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. However, as the marketing materials and private placement memorandums include information regarding the fund complex as a whole (i.e. the master fund in a master-feeder arrangement appears in such documents along with the relevant feeder funds, even though no investors can invest directly in the master fund and may only invest in the fund complex through a feeder fund), we have answered “Yes” for Question B.28.(a) of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. For any other-than-annual amendment where we are adding private fund(s) to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the data reported is as of the last day of the prior fiscal quarter month end date. All other responses are as of the last day of the prior fiscal year. Please note that Oaktree Gardens OLP SPV, LP included in Section 7.B.(1) is a feeder fund to the Oaktree Gardens OLP, LLC which is a BDC managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. This feeder fund has been excluded from Regulatory Assets Under Management as those assets are reported in the Regulatory Assets Under Management for Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC is a relying adviser structured as a limited liability company with multiple series. Identified in Section 4.A.2 of Schedule R are the direct owners of the management series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. The other series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC hold passive interests that do not confer control over the investment advisory activities of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. Accordingly, the owners of such other series have not been listed as direct owners in Section 4.A.2."

(“CIIEL”), and its Dublin, Ireland branch for certain services provided to the Adviser. CIIEL is a financial services firm authorized and regulated by the UK FCA and is designated as a Participating Affiliate of the Adviser in reliance on the Unibanco line of no-action letters. Consistently, CIIEL has submitted a Consent to Service of Process as a Participating Affiliate in the United States. The Adviser has declared that CIIEL and its employees are subject to service of process in New York, and for reporting purposes of this disclosure employees are considered supervised out of the main New Jersey office of the Adviser. Consistent with representations made by the Adviser to Staff of the SEC, CIIEL employees are subject to the Adviser’s Code of Ethics and, when applicable, its policies and procedures.  Item 5: Clients and Regulatory Assets Under Management, Section 7.B(1)&(2): A material number of Clients, with de minimus assets, who were formerly affiliates of the Adviser, terminated their relationships with Adviser between December 31, 2024 and the date of the Adviser's annual updating amendment.  In an effort to provide transparent information in the updating amendment, the Adviser's responses pertain to its Clients as of March 25, 2025 and reflect their RAUM as of December 31, 2024 (or the most recent regularly scheduled valuation prior to that date).   For separately managed accounts, regulatory assets under management are as of December 31st.  For private funds, regulatory assets under management are generally as of the most recent valuation available to reasonably file the Form ADV annual updating amendment within 90 days of the Adviser's fiscal year-end. For most funds, this is the Q3 September 30th valuation.  Item 5, Item 7, Item 9, and Schedule D Section 7.B.(1):   The Adviser provides services to certain accounts of affiliates who are wholly-owned by a common parent of the Adviser.  In these instances, the Adviser may rely on SEC No Action letters which provide relief from compliance with certain rules under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. For example, where owners of a separately managed account consist solely of affiliates of the Adviser all of whom are wholly-owned by a common parent, the Adviser disregards holdings that are equity interests in private funds that are also managed by the Adviser from its RAUM, and the Adviser relies on relief from compliance with the Custody Rule for the separately managed account provided by the CIGNA Capital Advisers, SEC No-Action Letter (Sept. 30, 1985) in its management and reporting of these separately managed accounts.  Item 9: In the Adviser's annual updating amendment filed March 31, 2025, responses to Item 9 are based on the same client population used to complete Item 5 and reflect fund and asset amounts as of December 31, 2024.  The Adviser notes that for certain of these clients, although the Adviser managed their assets as of December 31, 2024 the Adviser was not deemed to have custody of their assets until January 13, 2025.  For transparency in tying out RAUM and clients, the Adviser includes these clients and their assets (valued as of December 31, 2024) in responses to Item 9 because the Adviser has custody as of the filing date, however the Adviser notes it was not required to comply with the Custody Rule for these assets prior to January 13, 2025.  Item 5 and Section 5.K.(2): Derivatives: The Adviser only uses derivatives to hedge Client investments.  Client investments may be managed by the Adviser and included in RAUM, or Client investments may be managed by external managers where the Adviser is manager-of-managers and responsible for derivative hedging of the external manager's strategy.  The latter scenario may contribute to the appearance of a higher gross notional exposure, because investments managed by the external manager are not included in the Adviser's RAUM."

Information provided in Section 7.A. of this Form ADV excludes the general partners of such vehicles, as applicable. Upon request, complete information about such vehicles and their general partners, as applicable, will be made available to the Staff of the SEC.

Such private fund is no longer a client of the Registrant and therefore is not included in responses related to the Registrant’s number of accounts, clients or regulatory assets under management, and the responses to questions in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D are therefore “no” or “0” (as applicable).

Information provided in Item 5 includes regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”) (1) with respect to which an investment adviser that is a related person of the Registrant has delegated investment advisory authority to the Registrant; (2) attributable to the amount that clients of the Registrant have invested in clients advised by an investment adviser that is a related person of the Registrant; and (3) attributable to the amount that clients of related persons of the Registrant have invested in clients of the Registrant. As a result, per the instructions to Form ADV, the RAUM attributable to such delegated and/or invested assets are included in the RAUM of both the Registrant and such affiliated advisers.  Additionally, information provided in Item 5 excludes RAUM attributable to an investment by one client in another client that would represent a duplication of assets already included in calculating RAUM (so that such assets are counted only once); however, to the extent either or both of the relevant clients is a private fund, the gross asset value reported in Question 11 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D for each such private fund includes any such assets attributable to the amount invested in or by the other client.  Please note that the GSO Harrington Credit Alpha Fund L.P. master-feeder structure is 100% owned by a related person. Such related person is not a client of the Registrant but is a client of an affiliate. Accordingly, ""no"" and ""0"" are indicated in response to Questions 19 and 20, respectively, on Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. In addition, ""0"" is indicated in response to Question 12 of Section 7.B.(1) as such question is inapplicable.  The Registrant and its affiliates have little to no visibility on the underlying investors in the collateralized loan vehicles (""CLOs"") it manages. Thus, we are unable to provide certain information on the composition of the investors (e.g., number of beneficial owners, number of fund of funds investors, number of non-U.S. investors, etc.) and have included ""0"" (zero) in our response to those questions.  Schedule B: For each entry including either of Blackstone Inc. and Blackstone Holdings I/II GP LLC, the “Date Status Acquired” indicates the date the applicable entity originally acquired such status, notwithstanding any change in corporate form of Blackstone Inc. or Blackstone Holdings I/II GP LLC.  Schedule A: Ida Hoghooghi does not have a middle name. Panayiota (Toula) K. Bougiamas and William P Skinner have a middle initial listed.  Responses to the questions in Item 5.L reflect the period from March 1, 2025 to the filing date of this Form ADV."
