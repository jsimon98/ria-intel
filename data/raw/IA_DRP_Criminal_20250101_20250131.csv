I WAS DOING THE SPEED LIMIT, WHICH WAS 45 OR 50 MILES AN HOUR. I HAD NO SENSE THAT HE WAS EVEN BEHIND ME, LET ALONE TRYING TO PULL ME OVER.

AT THIS POINT ITA??S AROUND 1 AM. I OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE ARE TWO OFFICERS WHO ASKED ME TO COME OUT AND TALK WITH THEM. WHEN I STEPPED OUTSIDE THEY ASKED ME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE I WAS EARLIER THAT NIGHT. I TOLD THEM I JUST GOT HOME FROM WORK. THEY SAID OK AND ASKED ME TO WAIT OUTSIDE WITH THEM UNTIL ANOTHER OFFICER ARRIVED TO TALK WITH ME. THE OTHER OFFICER {THE ONE WHO ATTEMPTED TO PULL ME OVER) FINALLY ARRIVED TO THE HOUSE AND ASKED ME QUESTIONS. HE SAID THAT HE TRIED TO PULL ME OVER AND ASKED WHY I DID NOT STOP FOR HIM. I TOLD HIM I DID NOT SEE HIM OR HEAR HIM TRYING TO PULL ME OVER. HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS LYING TO HIM AND THEN ARRESTED ME. HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS CHARGING ME WITH A??FLEEING AND EVADING AN OFFICERA? AND THAT IT WAS A FELONY CHARGE. AS HE IS ARRESTING ME HE SAID THAT IF I WOULD HAVE JUST TOLD HIM THE TRUTH HE WOULD NOT BE ARRESTING ME. BUT SINCE I LIED HE IS GOING TO TEACH ME A LESSON. I SPENT THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY IN JAIL, THEN WAS RELEASED WHEN I PAID BOND. I WAS APPOINTED A PUBLIC DEFENDER GIVEN THAT I COULD NOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY. IN EXPLAINING MY STORY TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HE COUNSELED ME THAT I HAD A VERY LOW CHANCE OF WINNING MY CASE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT A JUDGE WILL SIDE WITH AN OFFICERS WORD THAN A DEFENDANT'S WORD.

UPON COMING TO A STOP SIGN I MADE A RIGHT-HAND TURN WITHOUT MAKING A COMPLETE STOP. THIS IS WHERE THE OFFICER SAYS HE WAS COMING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND ATTEMPTED TO TURN AROUND TO PURSUE ME FOR MAKING AN INCOMPLETE STOP. THAT EVENING THERE WAS HEAVY RAIN AND I WAS ON A MOTORCYCLE. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THE REPORT SAID THAT HE PURSUED ME AT 30 MILES AN HOUR FOR 15 SECONDS, OR HE PURSUED ME AT 15 MILES AN HOUR FOR 30 SECONDS BECAUSE IT WAS RAINING. I WAS DOING THE SPEED LIMIT, WHICH WAS 45 OR 50 MILES AN HOUR. I HAD NO SENSE THAT HE WAS EVEN BEHIND ME, LET ALONE TRYING TO PULL ME OVER. I DID NOT HEAR HIM, I DID NOT SEE HIM, IA??M CROUCHED DOWN ON MY MOTORCYCLE FOCUSING ON THE ROAD AND THE RAIN. ONCE I ARRIVE HOME, I START GETTING READY FOR BED THEN SOMEONE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR. AT THIS POINT ITA??S AROUND 1 AM. I OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE ARE TWO OFFICERS WHO ASKED ME TO COME OUT AND TALK WITH THEM. WHEN I STEPPED OUTSIDE THEY ASKED ME QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE I WAS EARLIER THAT NIGHT. I TOLD THEM I JUST GOT HOME FROM WORK. THEY SAID OK AND ASKED ME TO WAIT OUTSIDE WITH THEM UNTIL ANOTHER OFFICER ARRIVED TO TALK WITH ME. THE OTHER OFFICER {THE ONE WHO ATTEMPTED TO PULL ME OVER) FINALLY ARRIVED TO THE HOUSE AND ASKED ME QUESTIONS. HE SAID THAT HE TRIED TO PULL ME OVER AND ASKED WHY I DID NOT STOP FOR HIM. I TOLD HIM I DID NOT SEE HIM OR HEAR HIM TRYING TO PULL ME OVER. HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS LYING TO HIM AND THEN ARRESTED ME. HE TOLD ME THAT HE WAS CHARGING ME WITH A??FLEEING AND EVADING AN OFFICERA? AND THAT IT WAS A FELONY CHARGE. AS HE IS ARRESTING ME HE SAID THAT IF I WOULD HAVE JUST TOLD HIM THE TRUTH HE WOULD NOT BE ARRESTING ME. BUT SINCE I LIED HE IS GOING TO TEACH ME A LESSON. I SPENT THAT NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY IN JAIL, THEN WAS RELEASED WHEN I PAID BOND. I WAS APPOINTED A PUBLIC DEFENDER GIVEN THAT I COULD NOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY. IN EXPLAINING MY STORY TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER HE COUNSELED ME THAT I HAD A VERY LOW CHANCE OF WINNING MY CASE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT A JUDGE WILL SIDE WITH AN OFFICERS WORD THAN A DEFENDANT'S WORD. HOWEVER, HE SAID THAT HE WOULD TRY TO HELP ME BY TELLING THE PROSECUTOR MY STORY AND GO FROM THERE. ON COURT DAY THE PROSECUTOR WORKED WITH MY PUBLIC DEFENDER SAYING THAT SINCE I AM YOUNG AND STILL HAVE COLLEGE AND A CAREER AHEAD OF ME, HE WOULD REDUCE THE CHARGE FROM A A??FLEEING AND EVADINGA? FELONY; TO A A??RESISTING ARREST WITHOUT VIOLENCEA? MISDEMEANOR. BUT ONLY IF I WOULD PLEAD GUILTY TO THE MISDEMEANOR, PAY ALL THE FEES AND FINES, AND DO 1 YEAR PROBATION."
