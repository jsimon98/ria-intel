1985115,"Plainview Emerging Growth Fund (Private Fund Identification Number 805-1289286902) is organized as a Delaware series limited partnership and operates as a distinct and segregated series of Plainview Securities Fund, L.P., a master fund entity structured as an umbrella vehicle that holds no economic or beneficial interest in the assets, liabilities, or investment returns of any individual series. Each series is treated as a separate legal person for operational, accounting, and regulatory purposes. Plainview Emerging Growth Fund has filed a standalone Form D (File Number 021-536460) pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The Form D was filed under the Central Index Key (CIK) assigned to Plainview Emerging Growth Fund (CIK 0002047482), and the offering is conducted exclusively by that series. The investment adviser, Plainview Investment Management, L.P., is a Delaware limited partnership controlled by its general partner, Plainview Advisors, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company jointly owned in equal proportions by two control persons. Plainview Advisors, L.L.C. also serves as the general partner of Plainview Management, L.P., the general partner of the master fund. The same control persons are disclosed on Schedule A as executive officers and on Schedule B as indirect beneficial owners and control persons of the adviser through their ownership of Plainview Advisors, L.L.C. As of the date of this filing, Plainview Emerging Growth Fund has not yet commenced operations, and the gross asset value remains $0. No audit has been commissioned for the current fiscal year, and 0 percent of assets have been valued by an independent third party. Upon activation, the fund will engage NAV Consulting, Inc. as its third-party administrator to perform full-service fund accounting, capital account maintenance, net asset value calculations, investor reporting, and fee computation. NAV will also serve as the distributing agent for investor account statements and is not a related person of the adviser. NAV will not participate in portfolio management, execution, or marketing functions and maintains segregation of duties consistent with best practices under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Custody of fund assets is maintained with qualified custodians in both the United States and India, under accounts opened in accordance with applicable jurisdictional regulations. These custodial arrangements are part of the fund’s registration as a Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under Category I (FPI Registration Number: INFP19420240573). The FPI license is registered in the name of Plainview Securities Fund, L.P., the master fund, solely for administrative and regulatory convenience in compliance with SEBI’s umbrella registration framework; the Plainview Emerging Growth Fund is the sole beneficial owner of the FPI trading and custodian accounts associated with this registration. The umbrella master fund does not participate in investment activity, does not hold assets, and does not share in income or loss derived from any series. Pursuant to SEBI’s regulatory architecture, a Designated Depository Participant (DDP) has been appointed to facilitate onboarding and regulatory compliance under the Common Application Form protocol. The DDP performs ultimate beneficial ownership verification, tax residency screening, know-your-customer due diligence, and legal entity identifier validation prior to issuance of the FPI license. These functions are subject to continuing obligations under SEBI’s 2019 FPI Regulations and are monitored by the adviser in collaboration with the custodian’s compliance function. Securities transactions in Indian equity and derivatives markets are executed through an execution-only brokerage relationship that does not provide financing, margin lending, or any bundled prime brokerage services, and is not considered a prime broker under Rule 206(4)-2 or SEC Form ADV definitions. The fund does not utilize third-party placement agents, solicitors, marketing consultants, or capital introducers. All capital raising activities are conducted directly by the investment adviser and its principals, and no third-party compensation arrangements exist in connection with investor subscriptions. Due to procedural requirements imposed under Indian foreign exchange control regulations and SEBI’s FPI operational guidelines, all inbound remittances must originate from a U.S. bank account bearing the legal name of the FPI registrant. In order to comply with this requirement, any capital attributable to a specific series fund is first transferred internally within the fund’s U.S. banking infrastructure from the relevant series sub-account to the master fund account, from which the wire remittance is then initiated to the FPI custodian. Such transfers are strictly administrative and do not confer or imply any beneficial interest in series-level assets by the master fund. The fund is not currently subject to the custody rule’s audit requirement under Rule 206(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and no audit opinion has been received. The adviser will reevaluate audit requirements upon receipt of investor capital and update its disclosures accordingly. No person or entity other than those disclosed on Schedules A or B exercises direct or indirect control over the adviser, and none of the disclosed individuals or entities is a public reporting company under Sections 12 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Plainview Securities Fund, L.P., the umbrella master fund under which Plainview Emerging Growth Fund operates as a legally distinct series, is separately identified by Central Index Key (CIK) No. 0002053801 and is the named registrant under Form D File Number 021-536331. The master fund is registered as a Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under Category I and serves as the administrative entity for Indian regulatory and custodial compliance purposes. This narrative disclosure is submitted in conformity with applicable guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to memorialize the operational, regulatory, and structural posture of the adviser, fund, custodians, and affiliated service providers as of the date of filing. This language is further intended to provide transparent disclosure regarding the FPI registration layering, the economic segregation of the series within the umbrella structure, and the roles of third-party custodians, DDPs, and administrators in the fund’s compliance framework."

Each GP Entity is not filing its own Form ADV but is instead relying on the interpretive guidance outlined in the “Frequently Asked Questions on Form ADV and IARD” on the SEC’s website under the heading “Reporting to the SEC as an Exempt Reporting Adviser.” That guidance essentially permits a GP entity to a private fund to rely on the Form ADV of the fund’s investment adviser. In addition, as an ERA, the Registrant is not subject to Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act, and it is not currently subject to a state law equivalent, which would require fund investors to be qualified clients. As a result, Registrant has marked “no” in response to question 15(b) of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) for its private fund clients."

1986025,"Plainview Emerging Growth Fund (Private Fund Identification Number 805-1289286902) is organized as a Delaware series limited partnership and operates as a distinct and segregated series of Plainview Securities Fund, L.P., a master fund entity structured as an umbrella vehicle that holds no economic or beneficial interest in the assets, liabilities, or investment returns of any individual series. Each series is treated as a separate legal person for operational, accounting, and regulatory purposes. Plainview Emerging Growth Fund has filed a standalone Form D (File Number 021-536460) pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. The Form D was filed under the Central Index Key (CIK) assigned to Plainview Emerging Growth Fund (CIK 0002047482), and the offering is conducted exclusively by that series. The investment adviser, Plainview Investment Management, L.P., is a Delaware limited partnership controlled by its general partner, Plainview Advisors, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company jointly owned in equal proportions by two control persons. Plainview Advisors, L.L.C. also serves as the general partner of Plainview Management, L.P., the general partner of the master fund. The same control persons are disclosed on Schedule A as executive officers and on Schedule B as indirect beneficial owners and control persons of the adviser through their ownership of Plainview Advisors, L.L.C.  As of the date of this filing, Plainview Emerging Growth Fund has not yet commenced operations, and the gross asset value remains $0. No audit has been commissioned for the current fiscal year, and 0 percent of assets have been valued by an independent third party. Upon activation, the fund will engage NAV Consulting, Inc. as its third-party administrator to perform full-service fund accounting, capital account maintenance, net asset value calculations, investor reporting, and fee computation. NAV will also serve as the distributing agent for investor account statements and is not a related person of the adviser. NAV will not participate in portfolio management, execution, or marketing functions and maintains segregation of duties consistent with best practices under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Custody of fund assets is maintained with qualified custodians in both the United States and India, under accounts opened in accordance with applicable jurisdictional regulations. These custodial arrangements are part of the fund’s registration as a Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under Category I (FPI Registration Number: INFP19420240573). The FPI license is registered in the name of Plainview Securities Fund, L.P., the master fund, solely for administrative and regulatory convenience in compliance with SEBI’s umbrella registration framework; the Plainview Emerging Growth Fund is the sole beneficial owner of the FPI trading and custodian accounts associated with this registration. The umbrella master fund does not participate in investment activity, does not hold assets, and does not share in income or loss derived from any series.  Pursuant to SEBI’s regulatory architecture, a Designated Depository Participant (DDP) has been appointed to facilitate onboarding and regulatory compliance under the Common Application Form protocol. The DDP performs ultimate beneficial ownership verification, tax residency screening, know-your-customer due diligence, and legal entity identifier validation prior to issuance of the FPI license. These functions are subject to continuing obligations under SEBI’s 2019 FPI Regulations and are monitored by the adviser in collaboration with the custodian’s compliance function. Securities transactions in Indian equity and derivatives markets are executed through an execution-only brokerage relationship that does not provide financing, margin lending, or any bundled prime brokerage services, and is not considered a prime broker under Rule 206(4)-2 or SEC Form ADV definitions.  The fund does not utilize third-party placement agents, solicitors, marketing consultants, or capital introducers. All capital raising activities are conducted directly by the investment adviser and its principals, and no third-party compensation arrangements exist in connection with investor subscriptions. Due to procedural requirements imposed under Indian foreign exchange control regulations and SEBI’s FPI operational guidelines, all inbound remittances must originate from a U.S. bank account bearing the legal name of the FPI registrant. In order to comply with this requirement, any capital attributable to a specific series fund is first transferred internally within the fund’s U.S. banking infrastructure from the relevant series sub-account to the master fund account, from which the wire remittance is then initiated to the FPI custodian. Such transfers are strictly administrative and do not confer or imply any beneficial interest in series-level assets by the master fund.  The fund is not currently subject to the custody rule’s audit requirement under Rule 206(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and no audit opinion has been received. The adviser will reevaluate audit requirements upon receipt of investor capital and update its disclosures accordingly. No person or entity other than those disclosed on Schedules A or B exercises direct or indirect control over the adviser, and none of the disclosed individuals or entities is a public reporting company under Sections 12 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Plainview Securities Fund, L.P., the umbrella master fund under which Plainview Emerging Growth Fund operates as a legally distinct series, is separately identified by Central Index Key (CIK) No. 0002053801 and is the named registrant under Form D File Number 021-536331. The master fund is registered as a Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) under Category I and serves as the administrative entity for Indian regulatory and custodial compliance purposes.  Plainview Investment Management, L.P., the investment adviser to the above-referenced fund, was originally assigned CIK No. 0002047482 on December 5, 2024. A COUPDAT filing submitted on the same date amended the name associated with that CIK to Plainview Securities Fund, L.P. – Plainview Emerging Growth Fund. Subsequent filings under that CIK—including a Form D filed on December 11, 2024—have irrevocably associated both legal names with the same CIK. The Commission has confirmed that such association is not subject to administrative revision. Accordingly, all future EDGAR filings made by Plainview Investment Management, L.P., including this Form ADV and all subsequent Forms D, Form PF, or Form 13F, shall be submitted under CIK 0002047482. This compliance posture has been reviewed and affirmed in consultation with the Commission’s Filer Support Division and memorialized in the adviser’s internal compliance records.  This narrative disclosure is submitted in conformity with applicable guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to memorialize the operational, regulatory, and structural posture of the adviser, fund, custodians, and affiliated service providers as of the date of filing. This language is further intended to provide transparent disclosure regarding the FPI registration layering, the economic segregation of the series within the umbrella structure, and the roles of third-party custodians, DDPs, and administrators in the fund’s compliance framework."
