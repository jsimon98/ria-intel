1979039,"In Section 1.L. we have treated data stored in cloud-based servers that is accessible from our office (such as Global Relay) as being located in our office.   In Item 5.A., ""employees"" includes principals of the management company.    For the purpose of determining the number of firm ""clients"" in Item 5, we are including entities that may receive investment advice that is different (in whole or in part) from the investment advice given to another managed entity, except as further qualified below.  Hudson Bay International Fund Ltd. (the “Multi-Strat Offshore Feeder Fund”), Hudson Bay International Levered Fund Ltd. (the “Levered Feeder Fund”) and Hudson Bay Fund LP (the “Multi-Strat Onshore Feeder Fund,” and, collectively with the Multi-Strat Offshore Feeder Fund and the Levered Feeder Fund, the “Multi-Strat Funds”) are each hardwired into Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd. (the “Multi-Strat Master Fund”) and do not exercise investment discretion at the feeder level and we are therefore not currently counting them as clients separate from the Multi-Strat Master Fund. The Multi-Strat Onshore Feeder Fund invests most of its investable assets into the Multi-Strat Master Fund and invests the remainder of its investable assets in HB Fund LLC, which is counted as a separate client.  Hudson Bay Capital Structure Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. (the “Cap Structure Master Fund”) has a single feeder fund, Hudson Bay Cap Structure Arbitrage Enhanced Fund LP, and HBC Real Estate Fund II LLC (the “Real Estate Opportunities Fund”) has  a single feeder fund, Hudson Bay Real Estate Opportunities Fund LP. Given the current structure, it is unlikely that either of these feeder funds would ever trade independently of their master funds and we are therefore counting each of the Cap Structure Master Fund and the Real Estate Opportunities Fund as a single client. The Hudson Bay Special Opportunities Fund consists of a structure in which three feeder funds (the “Special Opps Feeders”) each invests into four master funds (the “Special Opps Masters,”) and a stand alone alternative investment vehicle (“AIV”) in which all the investors in the Special Opps Feeders, exclusive of one investor, invest directly (the Special Opps Feeders, the Special Opps Masters and the AIV, collectively, the “Special Opps Fund”).  Investments are allocated to the appropriate Special Opps Master based on tax considerations.  Because this is marketed and sold as one investment product, the Special Opps Fund is counted as one client.  Three of the four Special Opps Masters are non-US entities. Accordingly, for the purpose of answering Item 5.C.(2), the Special Opps Fund is counted as a non-US Person.  Despite being counted as only one client, each of the Special Opps Masters, along with the AIV, is listed on its own Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. For purposes of answering the gross asset value of each Special Opps Master and the AIV, we are treating gross asset value as regulatory assets under management (which includes committed but uncalled capital).  Because commitments are made at each Special Opps Feeder level and can be called into any Special Opps Master, the uncalled commitments from Special Opps investors has been attributed to the gross asset value for each of the Special Opps Master Funds. The AIV’s gross asset value is the aggregate committed capital of all its indirect investors (which is the same as the Special Opps Feeders investors, absent one investor). HBC Real Estate Fund LLC (the “REIT”) is a subsidiary of the Multi-Strat Master Fund and HB Fund, but also has certain outside investors who hold preferred shares.  Accordingly, it is counted as a separate client. Based on the above methodology, as of the 2024 annual ADV filing, Hudson Bay had 7 clients: (i) the Multi-Strat Master Fund; (ii) HB Fund LLC; (iii) the Cap Structure Master Fund; (iv) the Real Estate Opportunities Fund; (v) the Hudson Bay Insurance Dedicated Fund (the “IDF”); (vi) the Special Opps Fund; and (vii) the REIT. For purposes of answering Item 5.F., we are interpreting “Accounts” to mean “clients.”  For purposes of Item 5.F.3. (regulatory assets under management attributable to non-U.S. persons), we are treating offshore master funds as non-U.S. persons and are not looking through to the feeder funds.    In situations where a Hudson Bay fund has a cross investment in another Hudson Bay Fund, we count such investments in each individual Fund’s GAV for purposes of answering Question 11 of Section 7.B.(1) on Schedule D, but in order to avoid double counting for purposes of calculating firm-wide RAUM (Item 5.F.), we count such cross investments only once.  In such cases, the sum total of all the Hudson Bay Funds’ GAV is greater than the firm-wide RAUM.  For example, the Special Opps Fund has an arrangement with the Multi-Strat Funds whereby Multi-Strat Fund investors can “flex” their capital from the Multi-Strat Fund to the Special Opps Fund to meet capital calls.  Accordingly, the capital subject to the “flex” arrangement that is in the Multi-Strat Funds is counted separately towards the RAUM of each of the Multi-Strat Master Fund and the Special Opps Fund, but only counted once for firm-wide RAUM.  We have not included certain ""related persons"" in Item 7.A. that do not fall into any of the categories designated by items (1) through (16).  Such entities include Hudson Bay Capital GP LLC, which is the general partner of Hudson Bay Capital Management LP; Hudson Bay International Associates LLC and Hudson Bay Special Shareholder LLC, which are special shareholders of the Intermediate Fund; and Hudson Bay Capital Management (UK) Ltd, which is the corporate member of Hudson Bay Capital UK LLP. We have also not included dormant entities, as they are not providing “advisory services.”     The REIT is a captive fund within the Multi-Strat Funds’ structure whose equity is owned by Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd. and HB Fund LLC.  In order to meet certain regulatory requirements, there are 125 outside investors who hold preferred shares directly in the REIT (the “Preferred Shareholders”).  For purposes of the answering the ownership questions of Schedule D, Section 7(B)(1) (questions 12-16), we are counting each of the Preferred Shareholders and each of the Feeders as an owner, but are not looking through the feeders to their underlying investors, as that investor information is included in the schedule for Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd.  The REIT invests all its assets into a trading vehicle, HBC Real Estate Holdings I LLC (the “REIT SPV”), which itself invests in real estate instruments.  For purposes of answering question 8 of Schedule D, Section 7(B)(1), we are looking through the REIT’s investment in the REIT SPV in order to determine whether the REIT is a fund of funds.  For the purpose of answering Question 8 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (does the fund invest 10% or more of its total assets in other pooled investment vehicles) we are excluding special purpose vehicles in which all owners are entities within the same fund complex.  For the purpose of answering Question 13 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (number of beneficial owners), we count joint accounts as having a single owner.  For the purpose of answering Question 14 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (% of the fund owned by you and your “related persons”), we have included family members, related parties of Related Persons and private funds managed by the adviser as Related Persons.  With respect to Question 18.(b) of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the Multi-Strat Funds have a subadvisory agreement with High Trail Capital, which is a non-discretionary arrangement, whereby High Trail presents Hudson Bay with certain investment opportunities, but Hudson Bay retains full investment discretion.    For the purpose of answering Question 20 in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (% of clients investing in the fund) for all funds, we have: (i) disregarded the fund at issue; and (ii) collapsed all feeders into their master.  As a result, for purposes of this filing, we have 7 potential clients: (i) the Master Fund; (ii) HB Fund LLC ; (iii) the Cap Structure Master Fund; (iv) the Real Estate Fund Opportunities Fund; (v) the IDF; (vi) the Special Opps Fund; and (vii) the REIT.  Excluding the fund itself, the denominator in the calculation will always be 6.  The REIT is treated as investing in the Multi-Strat Master Fund, as it is embedded within the Multi-Strat Fund complex.   The Real Estate Opportunities Fund launched in 2025 and therefore, using 12/31 values, the value of all total asset related questions is 0.  For the purpose of answering Item 9, we have used regulatory assets under management (RAUM). We deem our custody to be held through our related persons (such as the general partner of certain feeder funds), and therefore list all custodied assets under 9.B.(2). Because the methodology to calculate the number of “clients” we use here focuses on custody, rather than independent investment advice methodology used to answer Item 5, the total number of firm “clients” differs in Items 5 and 9. The methodology used here is based on different investor groups, with the clients being: (i) Multi-Strat Offshore; (ii) Multi-Strat Onshore; (iii) Real Estate Opportunities Fund; (iv) HB Fund LLC; (v) Cap Structure Fund; (vi) IDF; (vii) REIT and (viii-x) the Special Opps Feeder Funds.  For the purpose of answering Item 9.F. (number of qualified custodians), we count an institution and all of its affiliates as a single custodian (i.e., UBS Securities and UBS AG)."

Confluence has two portfolio holdings: York European Opportunities Fund, L.P (“York”) with an estimated value of $71,940 and Infinity Q Volatility Alpha Fund, LP (“Infinity Q”) with an estimated value of $238,171. Confluence has a cash balance of $244,881 custodied by JP Morgan Bank NA and a money market fund with a market value of $917,315 custodied by Charles Schwab.  Confluence’s auditors have been unable to audit Confluence’s financial statements due to the failure of Infinity Q to provide audited financial statements. Infinity Q’s failure results from the activities described in the litigation and regulatory matters involving Infinity Q and its management. See e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission v. Infinity Q Capital Management, LLC, No. 23-civ- 05081 (S.D.N.Y. filed June 16, 2023); In re Infinity Q Diversified Alpha Fund Securities Litigation, Index No. 651295/2021; Dominus Multimanager Fund, Ltd. v.

In an effort to comply with Rule 206(4)-2 and act in the best interest of the Confluence investors, we have engaged BMO BANK NA, a qualified custodian, to hold the necessary Confluence documents. Confluence investors have received and will continue to receive statements and information, both from us and the administrator, regarding their interests in Confluence and the ongoing developments regarding Infinity Q."

1979730,"The purpose of this other-than-annual amendment is to update certain information included in Baker Street Advisors, LLC's Form ADV Part 2A and Form CRS regarding fee and billing practices and advisory services.  Item 5.D – Baker Street Advisors, LLC (“Baker Street”) has certain clients who have multiple accounts, including accounts for charities over which they are responsible.  In such cases, to avoid double counting when determining the “type of client,” Baker Street has generally designated the type as “High Net Worth Individuals,” as the client’s primary relationship with Baker Street is personal even though the client also has charitable accounts as part of the overall relationship.     Item 7.A - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (“AMG”), a publicly traded company, holds an equity interest in Baker Street through its holding company Watson Acquisition, LLC (“Watson Acquisition”).  AMG's equity interest in Baker Street is structured so that Baker Street maintains operational autonomy in managing its business.  The relationship between AMG , Watson Acquisition, and Baker Street is defined by an operating agreement that provides that neither AMG nor Watson Acquisition has the authority or the ability to operate or manage Baker Street’s business in the normal course.  Accordingly, AMG and Watson Acquisition are not “control persons” of Baker Street.  AMG also holds equity interests in certain other investment advisers (""AMG Affiliates"").  Each of the AMG Affiliates, including Baker Street, operates autonomously and independently of AMG and of each other.  Baker Street does not have any business dealings with these AMG Affiliates and does not conduct any joint operations with them.  Baker Street carries out its asset management activity, including the exercise of investment discretion and voting rights, independent of the AMG Affiliates.  Except as described in this Form ADV, the AMG Affiliates do not formulate advice for Baker Street's clients.  In certain cases, money managers selected by Baker Street may include AMG Affiliates and funds selected by Baker Street may be managed by AMG Affiliates.  However, neither AMG nor any AMG Affiliate has any involvement or influence in Baker Street’s selection of money managers.  As such, AMG’s ownership interest in Baker Street does not, in Baker Street’s view, present any potential conflict of interest for Baker Street with respect to our clients.  Consequently, information about individual AMG Affiliates is not listed in Section 7.A. of Schedule D of Part 1A of Form ADV.  A list of all AMG Affiliates is available to Baker Street’s clients upon request.  Item 9 - In certain instances, Baker Street is deemed, under federal securities laws, to have custody of certain client accounts by virtue of Baker Street’s specific Partners' roles as trustees to certain accounts, Baker Street’s authority from clients to pay bills from certain accounts, passwords to certain client accounts and/or the existence of standing letters of authorization (“SLOAs”) authorizing Baker Street to direct client assets from certain accounts to client-approved third parties.  In such cases, the assets are maintained by independent, unaffiliated qualified custodians and are subject to an annual surprise custody examination in compliance with Rule 206(4)2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

PwC informed the Adviser that a member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited performed a non-audit service for a portfolio company that the BlackRock Relevant funds acquired a controlling interest in Environmental 360 Solutions Inc.

From February 16, 2023, the date the Blackrock Relevant Funds acquired E360, through March 17, 2023, such member firm was engaged to act as the sole arbitrator during a proceeding between E360 and an unrelated third-party defendant, which is inconsistent with the auditor independence rules pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(4)(x) of Regulation S-X. The total fee associated with the service was approximately $40,000, all of which was incurred prior to the acquisition.  PwC communicated the facts and circumstances surrounding this service to the Adviser, including the scope and duration of this service and the associated fees incurred by PwC. PwC also noted the identified service did not have any direct accounting impact on the financial results of the BlackRock Relevant funds. The Adviser and PwC have separately considered the impact that the service may have had on PwC’s objectivity and impartiality with respect to PwC’s audit of the BlackRock Relevant funds. After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, PwC concluded that (i) PwC is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection with their audits of the BlackRock Relevant funds’ financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2023, and (ii) a reasonable investor, knowing all the relevant facts and circumstances, would reach the same conclusion.

Please also note the following:   • In completing this Form ADV, AMO USA has generally treated the individual private funds whose portfolios are advised by AMO USA as its advisory clients, except for the portfolios advised by AMO USA pursuant to investment advisory agreements between AMO USA and its affiliate, Asset Management One Co., Ltd. (“AMO JAPAN”) where AMO JAPAN is treated as an advisory client of AMO USA because AMO USA does not have an advisory relationship with the beneficial owners of the portfolios managed by AMO JAPAN.   • With respect to Item 5.D.(1) and Item 5.K, AMO USA has a single investor fund as a separately managed account as per the SEC’s FAQ.   • Item 5.D does not include clients reported in Item 5.C.(1), which consists of a bank and other investment advisers.   • With respect to Item 5.F. of Part 1A and Item 4.E. of Part 2A, AMO USA calculated regulatory assets under management (""RAUM"") as of December 31, 2024. AMO USA has calculated RAUM, consistent with the instructions to Form ADV, as the sum of the gross asset values of each of the private funds for which AMO USA provides investment advice, without any exclusion for the assets of any of those private funds that are invested in another of those private funds (except for a master-feeder arrangement). As a result, RAUM includes some assets that have been counted more than once.   • Calculated RAUM does not include the assets listed in Item 5.C.1, including the AMO USA's non-discretionary monitoring, and non-discretionary advisory services without placing trades to its parent company, other affiliates, or third party clients. AMO USA's assets under advisement for which the firm does not have RAUM was $ 14,738,337,304 as of December 31, 2024.   • The responses to Item 9.A.(2) and 9.B.(2), in relation to the approximate amount of client funds and securities over which AMO USA has custody, are based upon the gross assets under management of AMO USA.   • With respect to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, neither “ASSET MANAGEMENT ONE FEEDER FUND - AMO ARGO FEEDER FUND (LOW VOL)” (PFID: 805-2618509841) and “ASSET MANAGEMENT ONE FEEDER FUND - AMO FEEDER FUND 2” (PFID: 805-6945755502) is a feeder fund.

The figure reported in Item 5.B.(1) reflects only those employees who perform investment advisory functions for the Advisor itself, except that Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner, the founders of Avenue Capital Group, are included in Item 5.B.(1) on Form ADV for each registered investment adviser within Avenue Capital Group. The figures reported in Items 5.A. and 5.B.(1) are current as of April 2, 2025.  Items 5.F.(2) and 9.B.(2):    Avenue RP Opportunities Fund, L.P. (“Avenue RP”) has entered into an investment management agreement with the Advisor. Pursuant to a global services agreement, ACM2 and AACM may provide investment, administrative and risk management services to Avenue RP and its general partner, Avenue RP Opportunities Fund GenPar, LLC.    The entire value of the assets of Avenue RP is included in the regulatory assets under management of the Advisor, and custody of Avenue RP's assets is attributed to the Advisor.    The Advisor and ACM2 have entered into a global services agreement with Avenue PPF Opportunities Fund, L.P. (“Avenue PPF”) and its general partner pursuant to which the Advisor may provide investment, administrative and risk management services to such entities.     Pursuant to global services agreements among the Advisor, ACM2 and AACM, a portion of the assets of (i) Avenue Global Opportunities Master Fund, LP and Avenue Global Opportunities Fund, LP (collectively, ""Avenue Global Opportunities Fund""), (ii) Avenue Global Dislocation Opportunities Fund, LP (“Avenue Global Dislocation Opportunities Fund”) and (iii) Avenue Sports Opportunities Fund, L.P. and Avenue Sports Opportunities Fund (Offshore), L.P. (collectively, the ""Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds"") may be managed by the Advisor.   The entire value of the assets of Avenue PPF, Avenue Global Opportunities Fund, Avenue Global Dislocation Opportunities Fund and the Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds is included in the regulatory assets under management of ACM2, and custody of Avenue PPF’s, Avenue Global Opportunities Fund, Avenue Global Dislocation Opportunities Fund and the Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds’ assets is attributed to ACM2.    Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D:  The Advisor has related persons who are omitted from Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D of the Advisor’s Form ADV.  As a general matter, the Advisor’s business activities do not involve such omitted related persons.  The majority of such omitted related persons are general partners and/or sub-advisers to private funds managed by other affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group and are listed in each such filing adviser’s respective Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D.  Rather, the Advisor has listed all general partners and managing members of its private fund clients in Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D.  While not required to do so, the Advisor has determined to voluntarily disclose such information in its own Form ADV (as opposed to Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D of the Advisor’s affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers).    In addition, SPVs created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which are wholly-owned by the Advisor and/or its affiliates are not listed in Sec. 7.A. or Sec. 7.B.(1) of Sch. D, and do not carry out substantive business activities or function as “private funds.”  In addition, an SPV created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which accept investments from third-parties that are unaffiliated with the Advisor is not listed in Sec. 7.A. or Sec. 7.B.(1) of Sch. D so long as the SPV: (i) is a non-U.S. entity that does not use U.S. jurisdictional means to offer or sell its securities; or (ii) does not invest directly in securities.  The Advisor is affiliated with AMROC Investments, LLC (“AMROC”).  AMROC is not a broker-dealer of securities and is not registered with FINRA.    Q. 12: The minimum investment for each of Avenue Europe Special Situations Fund III (U.S.), L.P., Avenue Europe Special Situations Fund III (Euro), L.P. and Avenue Ireland Opportunities Fund SCSp is denominated in euros.  Q. 3(b) and 18(b): The entity set forth in response to Q. 3(a) of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has delegated all investment authority to the Advisor.  The entities set forth in response to Q. 3(b) of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have delegated all investment authority to the Advisor; such entities do not advise the fund(s). Entities listed in Q. 18(b), if any, provide sub-advisory services to the applicable fund, but the Advisor continues to have investment authority.  Avenue Europe Management, LLP, which is listed in Schedule R, acts as sub-advisers to certain of the funds.  Q. 23 for Avenue Europe Employee Participation Plan, LLC: For Avenue Europe Employee Participation Plan, LLC, the response to Q. 23(a) is “no” and responses to Q. 23(b-h) are left blank because this fund is not individually audited.  However, the funds that this entity invests in are affiliated funds of the Advisor and are audited annually.   Q. 27: For certain private funds, the administrator of the fund has been engaged to conduct an independent valuation analysis of a private fund’s portfolio in accordance with the fund’s valuation policies and procedures.  If the Advisor’s valuation results fall within an acceptable range of the administrator’s calculations, then the Advisor’s valuation amounts are accepted by the administrator.  In such instances, we have responded “0%” to Q. 27 because the administrator only affirms the Advisor’s valuations.   Q. 21 and 28 – Consolidated Master-Feeder Structure Entries: Responses to one or more consolidated questions in Sec. 7.B.(1) may not be applicable to the master fund.  The response in Q. 21 will be “No” for a master fund if it relied upon Sec. 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, while one or more consolidated feeder funds may have relied upon Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated under such Act. With respect to Q. 28, while a feeder fund may have utilized a marketer in respect of its investors, generally a master fund would not require such services.     Q.28: The agreement between the Advisor and any marketer listed in Q. 28 may include affiliates of the marketer.  Sec. 7.B.(2) of Sch. D: See Items 5.F.(2) and 9.B.(2) above for additional information about the Advisor’s agreements with Avenue PPF, Avenue Global Opportunities Fund, Avenue Global Dislocation Opportunities Fund and the Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds.  Items 8.A.(1) and 8.G.(1)-(2): The Advisor has neither engaged in principal transactions nor received soft dollar benefits in its most recent fiscal year, but may do so in the future.  Certain non-execution products and services may be provided by executing brokers, including, without limitation, research, and capital introduction events.  There is no expectation of order flow or any agreement to “pay up” for these products or services, however, and the Advisor does not believe that these constitute soft dollar items. To the extent that soft dollars are used in the future, any products or services acquired using soft dollars will be consistent with Sec. 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Schedules A and B: For entities which the Advisor does not control, the Advisor does not have the required information and as such it has not been provided."

LPL maintains a list of such names and will provide a copy of this list to the Commission upon request.

1969673,"SCHEDULE B: For federal income taxes purposes Davenport & Company LLC (the “LLC”) is organized as a limited liability company that is owned by five corporations that have elected to be taxed as S Corporations.  The multiple S Corporations are required due to tax law limitations on the number of permitted shareholders per each S Corporation.  Davenport's Schedule A lists the following five S corporations as direct owners: DAVENPORT & CO. OF VIRGINIA, INC; DAVENPORT CORP;  DAVA CORP; DAVENPORT IV, INC.; AND DAVENPORT FIVE, INC.  While this structure results in 5 direct owners of the membership units of the LLC; the only beneficial owners of the LLC are the shareholders of the S Corporations, all of whom are employees of the LLC.  For voting purposes, each individual shareholder of one of the S Corporation votes his or her shares on any matters with his or her S Corporation which in turn are relayed to the LLC without alteration.  Since the number of LLC membership units exactly equals the aggregate number of outstanding S Corporation shares, each vote by an S Corporation share is also an identical vote by a membership unit in the LLC.  Accordingly, it is our view that when calculating ownership percentages, we look to the ownership percentages of the beneficial owners of the S Corporations in the aggregate.  Thus, while an individual holding shares in a single S Corporation may own 10% of that S Corporation's shares, that same individual may have only 1% of the beneficial ownership of the membership units in the LLC. No individual employee indirectly holds more than 10% of membership interest of the firm.  SCHEDULE D, SECTION 7.B: DAVENPORT HAS CERTAIN RELATED PERSONS WHO ARE ALSO GENERAL PARTNERS OF FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE NOT LISTED ON SECTION 7.B OF SCHEDULE D.

To comply with the requirements of the Custody Rule, these funds undergo surprise custody audits by an independent CPA firm. An audit that follows the income tax basis of accounting, generally commences once the tax return is completed, because this would reflect the timing in which the K-1s are received from the underlying asset managers. As a result, the audit generally occurs following the completion of a fund's tax return and will not occur within 120 days of the respective fund’s fiscal year end (180 days in the case of a fund of funds),as required under the Custody Rule.   (2) A 2024 audit will not be conducted for the following funds because there was no activity or assets in the funds in 2024:  EXETER PARTNERSHIP 2024, LLC and REGENT STREET PARTNERS FUND 2025, LLC. With regard to question 23(g) in Item 7.B.(1), we have answered yes for the aforementioned funds as the financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal year will be distributed to investors.

1973787,"04/2025: This Other-Than-Annual Amendment is being filed to update information about Private Funds."
1975299,"At this time, General Atlantic Service Company, L.P. (“GASC”) is filing an other-than-annual amendment to reflect the inclusion of Actis LLP, Actis  GP LLP, Actis UK Advisers Limited, Actis EU Management S.a.r.l, and Neoma Manager (Mauritius) Limited (the “Actis Managers”) as relying advisers of GASC on Schedule R as a result of the closing of a transaction on October 1, 2024, whereby General Atlantic Partners, L.P. and certain of its affiliates acquired control of the Actis Managers. The Registrant has updated the following items and sections in Part 1, with respect to the Actis Managers, their clients and related persons, as a result of the closing of the transaction and combined investment advisory business of the Registrant and the Actis Managers: Item 1, Section 1.B, Section 1.I and Section 1.L; Items 5.D.(f)(1)/(3); Items 5.F(2)/(3); Schedule D, Section 7.A; and Schedule D, Section 7.B. Other information regarding the Actis Managers has not been updated or presented in the other-than-annual amendment as either a prompt amendment was not required or the information was not material, and will otherwise be updated and/or included in the Registrant’s next annual amendment.  Capitalized terms shall have the meaning set forth in GASC’s Brochure and/or the Actis Managers’ Brochure.  (1) The information presented in this Part 1 is as of March 1, 2025, except for the following responses, which are as of December 31, 2024: Item 5.C(1), 5.C(2), 5.D(1) and 5.D(3); Item 5.F(2)(a)/(d) and (c)/(f); Item 5.F(3); Item 5.K(2); Item 9.B(2)(a)/(b); Item 9.F; Schedule D, Section 7.B(1). With respect to Madison Park Investments, LLC (“MPI”) and Steamboat Park Investments, LLC (“SPI), the response for Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 11 reflects the gross asset value of MPI and SPI as of September 30, 2024. (2) The Core Program Partnerships (as described in GASC’s Brochure) are included on Schedule D, Section 7.B(1) as private funds to provide information about GA’s Core Program as a whole; however, they are not traditional private fund clients as investors (i.e., Core Program Limited Partners) do not subscribe directly to them and there is no offering memorandum for any individual Core Program Partnership, only for the Core Program as a whole. Core Program Partnerships are used to aggregate capital from Core Program Limited Partners to facilitate investments in Core Program portfolio companies. However, over the life of a commitment, a Core Program Limited Partner will participate in investments through multiple Core Program Partnerships. Consequently, no single Core Program Partnership is invested in every portfolio investment in the Core Program and an individual Core Program Limited Partner will not participate in all investments made by a given Core Program Partnership. As a result, the private fund-level metrics provided in Schedule D, Section 7.B(1) of Core Program Partnerships do not reflect the actual gross asset value of any single Core Program Limited Partner. The Core Program Limited Partners receive individualized statements and reports that reflect the performance of their investment portfolio, as spread out over multiple Core Program Partnerships, because GASC believes that statements and reports for the Core Program Partnerships as a whole would not be meaningful or relevant to them. For the avoidance of doubt, the number of clients and respective amount of RAUM disclosed in Item 5.D (including in Item 5.D(1)/(3)(f) – pooled investment vehicles) represents the number of Core Program Limited Partners (i.e., “clients”) who have entered into Commitment Agreements with GASC and GA LP, as well as GASC’s other private fund clients and the Actis Managers’ private fund clients. Whereas, the number of accounts disclosed in Item 5.F(2) reflect the number of Core Program Partnerships and other private funds managed by GASC, as well as the Actis Managers’ private fund clients. GASC will provide a list of the Core Program Partnerships upon request.  (4) Item 5.K. While certain Core Program Limited Partners enter into separate Commitment Agreements, GA LP and GASC do not provide individualized investment advice for each separate Core Program Limited Partner (and the Core Program Limited Partners only invest in the Core Program Partnerships on a go-forward basis). However, because Core Program Limited Partners are counted as a separate ""client"" for the purpose of the Form ADV, the Registrant has reported values in Items 5.D(1)(a) / (c) and (g) / (n) and Item 5.D(3)(a) / (c) and (g) / (n). As a result, the Registrant completed the questions in Item 5.K, even though it does not believe it manages separately managed accounts. See also note on Item 5.K(4) below.  (5) Certain of the entities identified in Schedule D, Section 7.A are general partners of the Registrant’s private funds and Core Program Partnerships and are related persons of the Registrant. In reliance on the position expressed in the SEC staff’s No-Action Letter to the American Bar Association, Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities, dated December 8, 2005 (the “ABA No-Action Letter”), each such related person is deemed to rely on and be covered by the Registrant’s registration.  (6) With respect to the questions regarding GASC’s related persons in Schedule D, Section 7.A, no portfolio companies of GASC’s Clients have been included in Schedule D, Section 7.A, although such portfolio companies currently include broker-dealers, other investment advisers and insurance companies, because such portfolio companies are operated by management teams that are independent of GASC. In certain cases, Supervised Persons of GASC sit on the board or committees of these portfolio companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GASC believes that such portfolio companies are not material to GASC’s advisory business or its Clients (other than their being portfolio companies) and do not create a material conflict of interest with GASC or its clients. GASC will provide a list of such portfolio companies upon request. With respect to the questions regarding the related persons of the Actis Managers in Schedule D, Section 7.A, the responses in Questions 11 and 12 have not been updated to reflect whether the Registrant and the related persons of the Actis Managers share any supervised persons or the same physical location and therefore, reflect the relationship between the Actis Managers and the respective related persons as of prior to consummation of the transaction noted above. The information in Schedule D, Section 7.A will be updated in the Registrant’s next annual amendment. (7) Schedule A: GASC is 100% owned directly and indirectly by General Atlantic Partners, LP (“GA Partners”). GASC GP LLC (“GASC GP”) is the general partner of GASC, which is wholly owned and controlled by GASC MGP, LLC (“GASC MGP”). GA GenPar Holdco (Bermuda), L.P. (“GA Bermuda”) and General Atlantic Management Holdco, L.P. (“GA Management Holdco”) own over 25% of GA Partners. GA Bermuda and GA Management Holdco are ultimately controlled by GASC MGP. GASC MGP is controlled by the Partnership Committee (formerly called the Management Committee). The Partnership Committee (i) oversees, manages and controls the affairs and business of GASC and (ii) primarily determines the strategic policy decisions of GASC MGP. Schedule A lists GASC GP, GA Partners, the Partnership and Executive Committee as of October 1, 2024, and executive officers of General Atlantic. Schedule B lists the entities that own and control GA Partners and the members of the Partnership Committee, which control GASC MGP.  (9) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 12. The minimum commitment amount reported for certain private funds is the minimum amount that is or was generally accepted from investors, provided, however, that GASC has the authority to accept commitments of lessor amounts.  (10) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 13. For any funds that were formed to allow GA employees to invest alongside the investment vehicles being offered to third party clients, beneficial owners were generally counted in accordance with the exclusion for investment companies under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Company Act”), even if the private fund is excluded from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(7) of the Company Act. Meaning, investors who were knowledgeable employees or qualified purchasers at the time they invested were not counted as beneficial owners of that private fund.  (11) In Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 15(b), the Registrant answered ""no"" for certain private funds because the Registrant does not receive performance-based compensation from the investors in those private funds.  (12) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 19. Certain of the private funds listed are alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) that were formed for the purpose of legal or tax structuring for a particular transaction or set of transactions. Since clients were not directly solicited to invest in those AIVs, the Registrant checked “No” to this question. Further, since GASC does not solicit investors to participate in AIVs/SPVs, the minimum commitment amount was listed as $0.  (13) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 25. The securities held with certain of the custodians listed for certain of the Core Program Partnerships may be held in the name of an affiliated special purpose vehicle instead of in the name of the private fund listed. As a result, it is impracticable for the Registrant to attribute RAUM to specific custodians by client for the purpose of Item 5.K(4).  (14) Schedule D, Section 7.B(1), Question 28. Reflects all placement agents currently retained by the private fund during the fundraising period, even if no capital was raised by the placement agent."
1954462,"As per the instructions for Item 7(c), ""If any private fund has issued two or more series (or classes) of equity interests whose values are determined with respect to separate portfolios of securities and other assets, then each such series (or class) should be regarded as a separate private fund."" In response to Item 7.B.(1), NorCap Securities Fund, L.P. is segregated into two separate series (“Series” or “Series of Units”), Series A: NorCap Real Estate Securities Fund and Series B: NorCap Opportunities Fund. To avoid double-counting of assets, NorCap Investment Management, L.P. (""NorCap or the ""Adviser"") has responded 0 for all fields within NorCap Securities Fund, L.P., and has provided the corresponding responses within each respective Series Fund. As of 12/31/2022, Series B: NorCap Opportunities Fund has been fully redeemed.   Capital Park GovPlus Segregated Portfolio was repurposed to Capital Park Premium Plus Segregated Portfolio, as the trading strategy in the Capital Park Premium Plus Segregated Portfolio is materially different.  In response to Item 9.F, NorCap has included all custodians in this number.   Effective January 1, 2023 an ownership change occurred resulting in changes of ownership percentages and personnel designations. This ownership change is also reflected in the Part 2A of Form ADV Brochure.   In December of 2019, NorCap’s S&P 500 Index strategies experienced a net loss that it believed was a result of Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), the Adviser’s prime broker and custodian at the time, changing margin requirements for the Adviser’s accounts. The Adviser firmly believed Jefferies acted in bad faith. As such, the Adviser (as General Partner) pursued Jefferies in an arbitration proceeding and sought compensatory damages, prejudgment interest, fees and costs, punitive damages, and additional relief. The arbitration was dismissed on April 29, 2022, and the Adviser received no compensation. The General Partner paid all the expenses of the arbitration. No expenses were charged to clients or investors.  Mr. David Norcom is no longer associated with the Adviser and has been removed from the Form ADV."

(2) Separate account clients and certain pooled investment vehicles invest in other of our pooled investment vehicles.

The total of the gross assets for each private fund listed in Section 7.B.(1)11 may be different than what is listed in Item 5.D.(f) because some pooled vehicles invest in other pooled vehicles, and such assets are included in the gross assets of both the investor fund and the investee fund."

1980110,"Matthew B. McCracken is concurrently registered as an Investment Adviser Representative of Strategic Financial Concepts, LLC (SFC) of San Antonio, TX.  His trading strategies for clients of SFC will overlap those of clients of the Firm.  As such, there is the potential for a conflict of interest to arise as Matthew could potentially leverage his authority over client accounts for the benefit of one firm’s clients or the other.  To mitigate this conflict, the Adviser will take deliberate actions to execute all trades with equitable pricing by implementing a strict practice of using Stop/Loss trade execution with identical prices.  However, trade execution at various firms is not always identical thus prices achieved may vary.  Furthermore, if the limit price is not available when the stop price is obtained, the Adviser will often manually trade the accounts in hopes of achieving best execution.  In these cases, it is more likely a price variance will occur between the clients of the Firm and the clients of SFC.  Clients of the Firm may inspect Matthew’s trading activity with Strategic Financial Concepts, LLC at any time."

ITEM 5.C.(1) AND SCHEDULE D, SECTION 7.B.(1)- FOR THE PURPOSES OF FORM ADV PART I, AB CARVAL REPORTS EACH 'MASTER-FEEDER' ARRANGEMENT AS A PRIVATE FUND.

1975716,"Observations Regarding the Methodology for Computing Number of Clients and Accounts: Pathstone may describe or refer to advisory clients in various materials, deliverables, regulatory filings, and agreements as “client relationships”, “family relationships”, “client accounts” or “client portfolios” depending upon the context and the reporting needs. This is not a complete or exhaustive list, but rather a small sampling of the various descriptions that may be used to describe advisory clients throughout firm materials. Additionally, the firm utilizes different legacy reporting practices across certain offices resulting in unique client identifiers, names, or descriptions of advisory clients, in part due to the integration of multiple legacy organizations, portfolio accounting systems, CRM software and client reporting preferences (e.g., flash estimates, monthly, quarterly, or other periodic reporting requirements of advisory clients).  As a result, with respect to the number of clients listed in Item 5C of Pathstone’s Form Part 1A, Pathstone includes each family relationship and each Affiliated Fund in the client count but excludes limited partners of these pooled investment vehicles that are not otherwise advisory clients of Pathstone. Additionally, for purposes of Item 5C, Pathstone generally does not separately count each sub-family relationship. Sub-family relationships are often grouped together using internal criteria such as the consolidation of related individuals and family entities covered under the same periodic reports, investment policies and/or agreements. A counting of each sub-family relationship, or alternatively each account, would result in a number much higher than the actual number of family relationships. With respect to the “Total Number of Accounts” in Item 5F, Pathstone generally counts each individual custody or prime broker account for each sub-family relationship, including individuals and family-related entities; where appropriate based on the nature of a legacy acquired advisory business and reporting practices, an account reported in Item 5F refers to a single client advisory relationship that may encompass a group of related individuals or entities. One unintended outcome of this methodology is that dividing the total discretionary AUM by the number of accounts in Item 5F (or the number of clients listed in Item 5C) results in an arithmetic average of AUM for each family relationship much smaller than the actual numerical average.   Observations Regarding Treating Affiliated Funds as Advisory Clients: Pathstone also provides advisory services to its Affiliated Funds pursuant to separate agreements and as a result, each Affiliated Fund is treated as an advisory client. Pathstone assists and advises with managing certain investment and business operations of the Affiliated Funds, in each case to the extent provided in the applicable governing agreement.    Observations Regarding Certain Limited Partners of Pathstone Affiliated Funds: Certain limited partners invested in the Affiliated Funds who have no other relationship with Pathstone (i.e., they are not receiving investment advisory services pursuant to a separate agreement), may be referred to as “Limited Partners”, “LPs”, “LP Only Investors”, “Non-client Limited Partner”, etc. depending upon the reporting practices of each legacy organization. As a result, such Limited Partners are not counted as advisory clients for Item 5C.     With respect to Section 5(K) 2, the only derivative transactions Pathstone reports on are structured notes. With respect to Item 5(K)2, Pathstone's strategy is not to effect borrowing transactions, however some clients have margin accounts that would permit them to borrow either for investment or non-investment purposes.  We are not filing a Schedule R for Saltbox II, LLC or PFO/CA Fund GP LLC, which are special purpose vehicles that we believe meet the fact patterns and conditions described in the 2005 Staff letter to the American Bar Association (ABA) and described in the 2012 Staff letter to the ABA as the “2005 Conditions"".  With respect to Schedule A, Pathstone Intermediate Holdings, LLC has indicated an employer ID of 00-0000000 since the entity does not have a CRD number, tax ID or EIN.  In aggregate, pooled investment vehicles controlled and/or managed by Lovell Minnick Partners LLC (“LMP”) hold an indirect interest in Pathstone Holdings LLC of greater than 25%. However, no single LMP managed/controlled entity owns more than the 25% which would trigger disclosure. As a result and in accordance with the Schedule B’s instructions, no Lovell Minnick entities are required to be disclosed on Schedule B."

PwC informed the Adviser that a member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited performed a non-audit service for a portfolio company that the BlackRock Relevant funds acquired a controlling interest in Environmental 360 Solutions Inc. (“E360”). From February 16, 2023, the date the Blackrock Relevant Funds acquired E360, through March 17, 2023, such member firm was engaged to act as the sole arbitrator during a proceeding between E360 and an unrelated third-party defendant, which is inconsistent with the auditor independence rules pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(4)(x) of Regulation S-X. The total fee associated with the service was approximately $40,000, all of which was incurred prior to the acquisition.  PwC communicated the facts and circumstances surrounding this service to the Adviser, including the scope and duration of this service and the associated fees incurred by PwC. PwC also noted the identified service did not have any direct accounting impact on the financial results of the BlackRock Relevant funds. The Adviser and PwC have separately considered the impact that the service may have had on PwC’s objectivity and impartiality with respect to PwC’s audit of the BlackRock Relevant funds. After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, PwC concluded that (i) PwC is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection with their audits of the BlackRock Relevant funds’ financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2023, and (ii) a reasonable investor, knowing all the relevant facts and circumstances, would reach the same conclusion. After considering these matters, and based on the totality of the information provided, the Adviser concurred with PwC’s conclusion.  Appendix A BlackRock Global Infrastructure Fund IV A, L.P.

Information provided in Section 7.A. of this Form ADV excludes the general partners of such vehicles, as applicable. Upon request, complete information about such vehicles and their general partners, as applicable, will be made available to the Staff of the SEC.

The Registrant has nevertheless included the private fund in Section 7.B.(1) for the purpose of reporting such private fund on Form PF. Such private fund is no longer a client of the Registrant and therefore is not included in responses related to the Registrant’s number of accounts, clients or regulatory assets under management, and the responses to questions in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D are therefore “no” or “0” (as applicable). In such cases where the Registrant had custody or deemed custody of the assets of such dissolved funds, the Registrant no longer has custody of such assets.

As a result, per the instructions to Form ADV, the RAUM attributable to such delegated and/or invested assets are included in the RAUM of both the Registrant and such affiliated advisers.  Additionally, information provided in Item 5 excludes RAUM attributable to an investment by one client in another client that would represent a duplication of assets already included in calculating RAUM (so that such assets are counted only once); however, to the extent either or both of the relevant clients is a private fund, the gross asset value reported in Question 11 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D for each such private fund includes any such assets attributable to the amount invested in or by the other client.  Please note that the GSO Harrington Credit Alpha Fund L.P. master-feeder structure is 100% owned by a related person.

Section 7.A. of Schedule D: The Advisor has related persons who are omitted from Section 7.A. of Schedule D of the Advisor’s Form ADV.  As a general matter, the Advisor’s business activities do not involve such omitted related persons.  The omitted related persons are general partners and/or sub-advisers to private funds managed by other affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group and are listed in each such filing adviser’s respective Section 7.A. of Schedule D.  In addition, SPVs created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which are wholly-owned by the Advisor and/or its affiliates are not listed in Section 7.A. or Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, and do not carry out substantive business activities or function as “private funds.”  In addition, an SPV created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which accept investments from third-parties that are unaffiliated with the Advisor is not listed in Section 7.A. or Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D so long as the SPV: (i) is a non-U.S. entity that does not use U.S. jurisdictional means to offer or sell its securities; or (ii) does not invest directly in securities.      The Advisor is affiliated with AMROC Investments, LLC  (“AMROC”).  AMROC is not a broker-dealer of securities and is not registered with FINRA. The Advisor is affiliated with TLOA Servicing, LLC and Middle River Power, LLC, companies formed for the purpose of supporting investments held by certain funds.  These entities did not fit within any of the categories listed in Q. 5 of Section 7.A. of Schedule D.  Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D:  Q. 3 and 18(b): The entity set forth in response to Q. 3(a) of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has delegated all investment authority to the Advisor.  Entities listed in Q. 18(b), if any, provide sub-advisory services to the applicable fund, but the Advisor continues to have investment authority.  The entity listed in Schedule R acts as sub-advisers to certain of the funds. Q. 23 for Employee Participation Plans: For each of Avenue Employee Participation Plan, LLC, Avenue Sports Opportunities Athlete Team Member Participation Plan, LLC and Avenue Real Estate Employee Participation Plan, LLC, the responses to Q. 23(a) are “no” and responses to Q. 23(b-h) are left blank because these funds are not individually audited. However, the funds that these entities invest in are affiliated funds of the Advisor and are audited annually.   Q. 27: For certain private funds, the administrator of the fund has been engaged to conduct an independent valuation analysis of a private fund’s portfolio in accordance with the fund’s valuation policies and procedures. If the Advisor’s valuation results fall within an acceptable range of the administrator’s calculations, then the Advisor’s valuation amounts are accepted by  the administrator. In such instances, we have responded “0%” to Q. 27 because the administrator only affirms the Advisor’s valuations. Q. 21 and 28 – Consolidated Master-Feeder Structure Entries: Responses to one or more consolidated questions in Section 7.B.(1) may not be applicable to the master fund.  The response in Q. 21 will be “No” for a master fund if it relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, while one or more consolidated feeder funds may have relied upon Reg. D or Reg. S promulgated under such Act. With respect to Q. 28, while a feeder fund may have utilized a marketer in respect of its investors, generally a master fund would not require such services.

Items 8.A.(1) and 8.G.(1)-(2): The Advisor has neither engaged in principal transactions nor received soft dollar benefits in its most recent fiscal year, but may do so in the future.  Certain non-execution products and services may be provided by executing brokers, including, without limitation, research, and capital introduction events.  There is no expectation of order flow or any agreement to “pay up” for these products or services, however, and the Advisor does not believe that these constitute soft dollar items. To the extent that soft dollars are used in the future, any products or services acquired using soft dollars will be consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.   Schedules A and B: For entities which the Advisor does not control, the Advisor does not have the information required by Schedules A & B. In these cases, such information has not been provided."

The majority of such omitted related persons are general partners and/or sub-advisers to private funds managed by other affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group and are listed in each such filing adviser’s respective Sec. 7.A. of Sch.

Such entities are owned by the investors in the applicable private fund and are not separately scheduled in response to Item 7.B.1, as the gross assets of the private funds named herein are inclusive of amounts invested through such alternative investment vehicles, and the other features of such private funds (e.g., fees and other terms) are applicable to such entities.  |  ""Master-feeder arrangement"": Centerbridge Credit Partners, L.P., Centerbridge Credit Partners TE, L.P. and Centerbridge Credit Partners Offshore, Ltd. invest their investable assets, either directly or indirectly, in Centerbridge Credit Partners Master, L.P. or its alternative investment vehicles.

The Registrant recently completed a review of these private funds and, in consideration of certain undertakings limiting borrowings by such entities to amounts that do not exceed the thresholds specified in the definition of “hedge fund,” reclassified a number of them as “private equity funds” in question 10.  |  Regulatory assets under management (“RAUM”), private fund gross asset values, and the amount of client funds for which the Registrant and its related persons have custody are reported as of 12/31/2024. Martello Re Limited, a reinsurance vehicle formed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (“MassMutual”), commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2021; Centerbridge Martello Advisors, L.L.C. and Barings LLC (which is affiliated with MassMutual but not with the Registrant) both provide investment advisory services in a joint-venture arrangement. In the case of the Martello Re structure, assets from SC IV, CB Martello Feeder, L.P., CB Martello Feeder II, L.P., CB Martello SBS, L.P., BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC – Martello Re Series, BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust – Martello Re Sub-Trust and BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series II also are reflected in the RAUM attributed to insurance company clients in light of the different nature of the advisory mandates and distinct associated advisory fees payable to the applicable advisers. For purposes of Section 5.K.(1) of Schedule D, Centerbridge is including in the breakdown of asset types those assets custodied by Centerbridge. CB AG Fund, L.P., and Park Blue CLO 2024-VI, Ltd. received commitments and/or commenced or will commence operations as private funds after 12/31/2024, thus for each the gross asset value reported in response to question 11 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 is zero. The assets under management calculation, as expressed in ADV Part 2A, applies a different methodology that results in a figure different from regulatory assets under management.  |  The 12/ 17/2020 Amendment to this Form ADV included changes to reflect the retirement of Mark Gallogly in December 2020. In the case of certain entities, ownership (including capital) of limited partnership interests results in “Control Person” status in certain sections of Schedule R. The Registrant notes that as it relates to disclosures in Schedule A, Vivek Melwani does not have a middle name or middle initial.  |  With respect to Item 6, the Registrant may from time to time have its employees or other representatives on the boards of directors and/or other committees, or acting in management roles, of certain companies in which one or more private funds are invested.  |  With respect to the questions regarding the Registrant’s related persons in Item 7, certain companies owned by Registrant’s related persons are, or may become, during the course of the related person’s investment, involved in financial services and/or investment advisory activities, which may include status as broker-dealers, investment companies or other pooled investment vehicles or investment advisers, among other things. The Registrant formed collateralized bond obligation (CBO) vehicles Centerbridge Credit Funding 1, Ltd. (“CBO 1”) and Centerbridge Credit Funding II, Ltd. (“CBO II”) and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) vehicles Park Blue CLO 2022-I, Ltd. (“CLO I”), Park Blue CLO 2022-II, Ltd. (“CLO II”), Park Blue CLO 2023-III, Ltd. (CLO III), Park Blue CLO 2023-IV, Ltd. (“CLO IV”), Park Blue CLO 2024-V, Ltd. (“CLO V”) and Park Blue CLO 2024-VI, Ltd. (“CLO VI”) (the aforementioned CBO and CLO vehicles, collectively, the “CDO Vehicles”). As of Registrant’s last Form ADV annual filing, Centerbridge Special Credit III-Flex, L.P. (SC III-Flex) owned equity in CBO 1, CBO II and CLO II, and SC IV owned equity in CLO IV and CLO V. Furthermore, subsequent to December 31, 2024 and prior to the filing date for Registrant’s last Form ADV annual filing, SC IV purchased equity in CLO VI. Centerbridge Credit Funding Advisors, LLC, which is identified in this Form ADV as a relying adviser of the Registrant, provides advisory services to the CDO Vehicles, and may in the future provide advisory services to other vehicles that are similar in nature.  |  Responses to question 13 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 include where applicable investors who have made capital commitments that have not had capital called. CB AG Fund, L.P., Park Blue CLO 2024-VI, Ltd., Centerbridge Flex Partners Master, L.P., Centerbridge Flex Partners, L.P., Centerbridge Flex Partners Cayman, L.P., Centerbridge FP Co-Invest Fund, L.P. and CB LDV Co-Invest, L.P. - Series A, commenced or will commence operations as private funds after 12/31/2024 and, consequently, the calculation of net asset values (“NAV”) for these private funds would yield a result that the Registrant does not consider to be meaningful; therefore, questions 14 through 16 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1, which are calculated based on NAV, show zero as responses for such private funds.  SC III-Flex was initially the sole investor in the equity of CLO I, CLO II and CLO III, and SC IV was initially the sole investor in the equity of CLO V. SC III-Flex no longer holds equity interests in CLO I and CLO III and is no longer the sole holder of equity interests in CLO II, and SC IV is no longer the sole holder of equity interests in CLO V, both having sold some or all such interests. The sold equity interests now may trade in secondary market transactions that the Registrant does not have visibility into, thus the Registrant’s responses to questions 13 through 16 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 for the CDO Vehicles describe the beneficial ownership of equity interests held, if any, by SC III-Flex or SC IV. The responses in the schedule to Item 7.B.1 pertaining to BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series, BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust and BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series II are provided in reliance on information provided by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. (“BBH Co”), which Registrant has not itself independently verified. Per BBH Co, BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA); however, the trust’s sub-trusts, including Martello Re Sub-Trust, are not separately registered with CIMA, therefore the Registrant has not listed CIMA in the response to question 5 in the schedule to Item 7.B.1. for BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust. BBH Co intends to have an extended audit period for BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series II, from the date of the first capital call on December 19, 2024 through December 31, 2025. As a result, the first audited financial statements for that fund are not expected to be available until approximately mid-2026. As a result of that extended audit period, the response for that fund to question 23(h) in the schedule to Item 7.B.1. will remain “Report Not Yet Received” until the completion of the first audit in 2026.   |  The Registrant is affiliated with Overland Advisors, LLC, with which the Registrant has a relationship, including the provision of resources pursuant to a resource sharing agreement. Overland Advisors, LLC has been formed to provide investment advice to a business development company and is a separate investment adviser with its own Form ADV filing (https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/325525).   |  This 4/30/2025 Amendment was filed for the purpose of updating the response to question 23(h) in the schedule to Item 7.B.1. for certain private funds."

Section 1.L. of Schedule D.:  Third-party attorneys of the Advisor hold documents evidencing indicia of ownership of certain uncertificated assets, including without limitation, private credit assets, bank debt and trade claims held by funds managed by the Advisor, which are not listed in Section 1.L. of Schedule D.    Sec. 1.M. of Sch. D: For clarification purposes, please note that Avenue ME Advisors Ltd is the holder of Financial Services Permission to Conduct Regulated Activities, Prudential Category 4, to conduct the regulated activities of Arranging Deals in Investments and Advising on Investments or Credit, granted by the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Items 5.A. and 5.B.(1): The figure reported in Item 5.A. reflects the employees of Avenue Capital Group as a whole, of which the Advisor is one of several affiliated registered investment advisers.  The figure reported in Item 5.B.(1) reflects only those employees who perform investment advisory functions for the Advisor itself, except that Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner, the founders of Avenue Capital Group, are included in Item 5.B.(1) on Form ADV for each registered investment adviser within Avenue Capital Group. The figures reported in Items 5.A. and 5.B.(1) are current as of April 2, 2025.  Item 5.F. and Item 9:  Pursuant to global services agreements between the Advisor and AEIM, AEIM may provide investment, administrative and risk management services to Avenue PPF Opportunities Fund, L.P. (“Avenue PPF”) and its respective general partners.  Pursuant to global services agreements between the Advisor, AEIM and AACM, AEIM and AACM may provide investment, administrative and risk management services to Avenue Global Opportunities Master Fund, L.P. and Avenue Global Opportunities Fund, L.P.

(collectively, ""Avenue Sports""), and their respective general partners. The entire value of the assets of Avenue PPF, Avenue Global, Avenue GDF and Avenue Sports is included in the regulatory assets under management of the Advisor, and custody of Avenue PPF’s, Avenue GDF's, Avenue Global's and Avenue Sports' assets is attributable to the Advisor.  Avenue RP Opportunities Fund, L.P. (“Avenue RP”) has entered into an investment management agreement with AEIM. Pursuant to a global services agreement among Avenue RP, AEIM, AACM and the Advisor, the Advisor may provide investment, administrative and risk management services to Avenue RP and its general partner. The entire value of the assets of Avenue RP is included in the regulatory assets under management of AEIM, and custody of Avenue RP's assets is attributed to AEIM.    Section 7.A. of Schedule D: The Advisor has related persons who are omitted from Section 7.A. of Schedule D of the Advisor’s Form ADV.  As a general matter, the Advisor’s business activities do not involve such omitted related persons.  The omitted related persons are general partners and/or sub-advisers to private funds managed by other affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group and are listed in each such filing adviser’s respective Section 7.A. of Schedule D.  In addition, SPVs created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which are wholly-owned by the Advisor and/or its affiliates are not listed in Section 7.A. or Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, and do not carry out substantive business activities or function as “private funds.”  In addition, an SPV created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which accept investments from third-parties that are unaffiliated with the Advisor is not listed in Section 7.A. or Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D so long as the SPV: (i) is a non-U.S. entity that does not use U.S. jurisdictional means to offer or sell its securities; or (ii) does not invest directly in securities.      The Advisor is affiliated with AMROC Investments, LLC  (“AMROC”).  AMROC is not a broker-dealer of securities and is not registered with FINRA. The Advisor is affiliated with TLOA Servicing, LLC and Middle River Power, LLC, companies formed for the purpose of supporting investments held by certain funds.  These entities did not fit within any of the categories listed in Q. 5 of Section 7.A. of Schedule D.  Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D:  Q. 3 and 18(b): The entity set forth in response to Q. 3(a) of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has delegated all investment authority to the Advisor.  Entities listed in Q. 18(b), if any, provide sub-advisory services to the applicable fund, but the Advisor continues to have investment authority.  The entity listed in Schedule R acts as sub-advisers to certain of the funds. Q. 23 for Employee Participation Plans: For each of Avenue Employee Participation Plan, LLC, Avenue Sports Opportunities Athlete Team Member Participation Plan, LLC and Avenue Real Estate Employee Participation Plan, LLC, the responses to Q. 23(a) are “no” and responses to Q. 23(b-h) are left blank because these funds are not individually audited. However, the funds that these entities invest in are affiliated funds of the Advisor and are audited annually.   Q. 27: For certain private funds, the administrator of the fund has been engaged to conduct an independent valuation analysis of a private fund’s portfolio in accordance with the fund’s valuation policies and procedures. If the Advisor’s valuation results fall within an acceptable range of the administrator’s calculations, then the Advisor’s valuation amounts are accepted by  the administrator. In such instances, we have responded “0%” to Q. 27 because the administrator only affirms the Advisor’s valuations. Q. 21 and 28 – Consolidated Master-Feeder Structure Entries: Responses to one or more consolidated questions in Section 7.B.(1) may not be applicable to the master fund.  The response in Q. 21 will be “No” for a master fund if it relied upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, while one or more consolidated feeder funds may have relied upon Reg. D or Reg. S promulgated under such Act. With respect to Q. 28, while a feeder fund may have utilized a marketer in respect of its investors, generally a master fund would not require such services.  Q.28: The agreement between the Advisor and any marketer listed in Q. 28 may include affiliates of the marketer.    Items 8.A.(1) and 8.G.(1)-(2): The Advisor has neither engaged in principal transactions nor received soft dollar benefits in its most recent fiscal year, but may do so in the future.  Certain non-execution products and services may be provided by executing brokers, including, without limitation, research, and capital introduction events.  There is no expectation of order flow or any agreement to “pay up” for these products or services, however, and the Advisor does not believe that these constitute soft dollar items. To the extent that soft dollars are used in the future, any products or services acquired using soft dollars will be consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.   Schedules A and B: For entities which the Advisor does not control, the Advisor does not have the information required by Schedules A & B. In these cases, such information has not been provided."

Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D:  The Advisor has related persons who are omitted from Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D of the Advisor’s Form ADV.  As a general matter, the Advisor’s business activities do not involve such omitted related persons.  The majority of such omitted related persons are general partners and/or sub-advisers to private funds managed by other affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group and are listed in each such filing adviser’s respective Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D.  Rather, the Advisor has listed all general partners and managing members of its private fund clients in Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D.  While not required to do so, the Advisor has determined to voluntarily disclose such information in its own Form ADV (as opposed to Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D of the Advisor’s affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers).    In addition, SPVs created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which are wholly-owned by the Advisor and/or its affiliates are not listed in Sec. 7.A. or Sec. 7.B.(1) of Sch. D, and do not carry out substantive business activities or function as “private funds.”  In addition, an SPV created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which accept investments from third-parties that are unaffiliated with the Advisor is not listed in Sec. 7.A. or Sec. 7.B.(1) of Sch.

The entities set forth in response to Q. 3(b) of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have delegated all investment authority to the Advisor; such entities do not advise the fund(s). Entities listed in Q. 18(b), if any, provide sub-advisory services to the applicable fund, but the Advisor continues to have investment authority.  Avenue Europe Management, LLP, which is listed in Schedule R, acts as sub-advisers to certain of the funds.  Q. 23 for Avenue Europe Employee Participation Plan, LLC: For Avenue Europe Employee Participation Plan, LLC, the response to Q. 23(a) is “no” and responses to Q. 23(b-h) are left blank because this fund is not individually audited.  However, the funds that this entity invests in are affiliated funds of the Advisor and are audited annually.   Q. 27: For certain private funds, the administrator of the fund has been engaged to conduct an independent valuation analysis of a private fund’s portfolio in accordance with the fund’s valuation policies and procedures.  If the Advisor’s valuation results fall within an acceptable range of the administrator’s calculations, then the Advisor’s valuation amounts are accepted by the administrator.  In such instances, we have responded “0%” to Q. 27 because the administrator only affirms the Advisor’s valuations.

The response in Q. 21 will be “No” for a master fund if it relied upon Sec. 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, while one or more consolidated feeder funds may have relied upon Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated under such Act.

D: See Items 5.F.(2) and 9.B.(2) above for additional information about the Advisor’s agreements with Avenue PPF, Avenue Global Opportunities Fund, Avenue Global Dislocation Opportunities Fund and the Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds.

Notwithstanding the examiners' guidance, there are referral opportunities for products and services by these accountants in their capacities as accountants on the one hand, and as investment adviser representatives, on the other. The potential for earning additional compensation by cross-selling a client of one business with the products of the other business raises the conflict of making recommendations in the representative's economic interest, rather than the client's need for a suitable investment.

Notwithstanding the examiners' guidance, there are referral opportunities for products and services by these accountants in their capacities as accountants on the one hand, and as investment adviser representatives, on the other.

In completing this Form ADV, Part 1A, NWI Management LP (the “Investment Manager”) has generally treated the individual private funds and collective investment schemes whose portfolios are managed by the Investment Manager as its advisory clients.  However, in completing the following items, the Investment Manager has responded as if its advisory clients were the investors in the private funds operated by the Investment Manager, rather than the private funds themselves: Item 5.B.(6); Item 5.C.(2); Item 5.F.(3); Item 8.H.; Item 8.I; and Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (Questions 19 and 20).  This approach should not be deemed to be an acknowledgment that such investors are, in fact, advisory clients of the Investment Manager (as they are not).  The Investment Manager believes, in good faith, that the foregoing is the manner most useful to the reader when completing these items. 2.	With respect to Item 5.F. of Part 1A, the Investment Manager has calculated regulatory assets under management, consistent with the instructions to Form ADV, as the sum of the gross asset values of each of the private funds for which the Investment Manager provides investment advice.  However, gross assets attributable to private funds that invest in other private funds have been excluded to the extent of the investment in the other private fund to avoid counting the same assets twice.  For example, in the case of master/feeder arrangements, only the gross asset value of the feeder funds have been included and the gross asset value of the master funds have been excluded.  For Item 4.E. of Part 2A, the Investment Manager has calculated net assets under management in a similar manner. 3.	The responses to Items 9.A.(2) and 9.B.(2), in relation to the approximate amount of client funds and securities over which the Investment Manager has custody, are based upon the net assets under management of the Investment Manager. 4.	With respect to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, for purposes of disclosing the beneficial ownership information for Questions 12 through 16 for any private fund that is a master fund, the Investment Manager has looked-through to the beneficial owners of the feeder funds. Percentages in responses to Questions 14 through 16 are based on the beneficial owners’ respective shares of the private fund’s net assets under management.  Similarly, in responding to Questions 19 and 20, the Investment Manager has responded as if each of the investors in the private funds managed by the Investment Manager, rather than private funds themselves, are the clients.  In responding to Question 20, the Investment Manager has provided the percentage of its net assets under management represented by each private fund.  The Investment Manager believes, in good faith, that the foregoing is the manner most useful to the reader when completing these items. 5.

Accordingly, no Indirect Owners of DASTA Incorporated are reported in Schedule B."
1979032,"Item 2.C. - Notice filings are provided to Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Colorado due to the remote work status of certain employees of the Adviser.  Item 5.D. – The Adviser serves as investment adviser to 21 private investment funds; however, 7 of these funds have a single insurance company investor.  In accordance with the Staff’s FAQs on Item 5.D. of Form ADV (posted June 12, 2017), the Adviser has included the insurance company investor for these 7 single-investor funds in row (k).  The other private investment funds are reflected in row (f) because they are not single-investor funds. The Adviser serves as collateral manager for six collateralized loan obligation private funds. A newly formed fund, 720 East CLO VII, LTD., is in warehouse phase as of December 31, 2024, but the placement agent expects to launch this fund on March 31, 2025. Accordingly, we included this fund in our regulatory assets under management and client total.  Item 5.F.(2) – The Adviser’s clients consist primarily of its parent, The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (“Northwestern Mutual”), and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Northwestern Mutual enterprise.  As of December 31, 2024, these entities represented approximately $293.5billion of the Adviser’s $299.9billion of regulatory assets under management.   Northwestern Mutual owns interests in certain private investment funds for which NMIMC serves as investment adviser and collateral manager.  In accordance with the instructions for Part 1A, the value of these interests has been included in the assets NMIMC manages on behalf of Northwestern Mutual and in the applicable private funds.     Item 9 - $293.2billion, which represents the amount of assets managed on behalf of Northwestern Mutual and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Northwestern Mutual enterprise, has been excluded from Item 9 in reliance on the SEC staff's position in a prior no-action letter.  See Cigna Capital Advisors, SEC No-Action Letter (September 30, 1985).  Additionally, as noted above with respect to Item 5.D., the Adviser serves as investment adviser to 15 private co-investment funds. For purposes of Item 5.D., in accordance with the Staff’s FAQ cited above, the Adviser has counted the insurance company investor in the single-investor funds as a client, and the funds as clients for the funds that have more than one investor. Certain of those private co-investment funds are audited annually by an independent public accountant and audited financials are distributed to those funds’ investors under Section 206(4)-2(b)(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. See the SEC Staff’s FAQs on the Custody Rule, Question VI.11.  The responses to Items 9A. and 9B. both include assets of the 15 private co-investment fund clients referred to above in relation to Item 5.D. With respect to Item 9.A., the general partner of 13 of the 15 private investment funds is a related person of NMIMC and, as indicated in response to Item 7.A., is a SPV that relies on NMIMC’s Form ADV registration in reliance on the staff’s no-action letter ABA Subcommittee of Private Investment Entities (December 8, 2005). With response to Item 9.B., NMIMC may be deemed to have custody of the assets of certain private co-investment fund clients due to the authority of its related person, Northwestern Mutual.      Schedule D, Section 7.A. - Certain related persons have been omitted from Section 7.A. of Schedule D because the Adviser (1) has no business dealings with such related persons in connection with advisory services it provides to clients, (2) does not conduct shared operations with such related persons, (3) does not refer clients or business to the related persons, and the related persons do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser, (4) does not share supervised persons or premises with the related persons and (5) has no reason to believe that its relationship with the related persons otherwise creates a conflict of interest with its clients.  A supplementary list of related persons that are in one or more of the categories listed in Section 7.A. will be provided upon request.  The foreign financial regulatory authorities identified in response to Schedule D, Section 7.A., Question 10.(b) for Northwestern Mutual refer to markets in which sub-custodian accounts are open and there is authority to trade in the local market.   720 East CLO 2022-I, LTD.; 720 East CLO 2023-I, LTD.; 720 East CLO 2023-II, LTD.; 720 East CLO IV, LTD.; 720 East CLO V, LTD.; 720 East CLO VI, LTD.; and 720 East CLO VII, LTD. Item 28 - We have endeavored to provide private fund reporting information as accurately as possible with respect to collateralized loan obligation vehicles, even where we feel certain questions are inapplicable or cannot be accurately responded to with the response options provided. For example, beneficial interests in securities issued by these collateralized loan obligation vehicles are traded through a depositary institution that does not provide the adviser with detail on identity or number of beneficial owners. Since questions 13, 15 and 16 in section 7.B(1) do not allow us to leave these items blank, we have responded with 'zero' ('0') but expressly disclaim the answers provided for these questions. In addition, the primary offering of a collateralized loan obligation vehicle is generally conducted through a placement agent, but the activities of the placement agent are not ongoing after the launch of the vehicle. As a result, in question 28 of section 7.B.(1), we have named the placement agent, for collateralized loan obligation vehicles when the primary offering occurred. .  Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) – The amounts listed for required minimum investment commitments reflect minimums set forth in each private fund’s Form D Notice of Sale of Securities.  Individual commitments of lesser amounts may be accepted at the discretion of the general partner for each fund.  In addition, with respect to the single investor funds described above, the number of beneficial owners for each fund includes a third-party investor, as well as a general partner entity affiliated with the Adviser. Northwestern Mutual Private Equity Co-Investment Fund IV, LP will be subject to an annual audit, however the investment period for this fund commenced on January 1, 2025, and Regulatory Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024, consisted solely of uncalled capital commitments. Accordingly, this fund did not have an annual audit for year ended December 31, 2024."

1983366,"For Schedule D, Section 1.F, Global Infrastructure Management, LLC and its affiliates (“GIM”) maintain a liaison office in Seoul, Korea, and certain private funds maintain a Luxembourg office for regulatory local presence requirements. GIM can provide additional information regarding these locations upon request.  For Item 5, regulatory assets under management reflect the gross aggregate value of the assets held by private funds and separately managed accounts as of year-end plus unfunded capital commitments. GIM forms special purpose vehicles to serve as the general partners or managing members of certain private funds managed by GIM and are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC letter addressed to the American Bar Association’s Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities dated October 8, 2005, as updated on January 18, 2012. From time to time, certain private funds and separately managed accounts make investments through alternative investment vehicles and holding companies (collectively “AIVs”) that GIM forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory, or other structuring reasons. The AIVs have not been separately reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), but information regarding the AIVs has been aggregated with the private funds or separately managed accounts to which they relate. Regulatory assets under management and gross asset values are estimated and unaudited and may differ materially from the final audited amounts. Certain entities recently formed or being wound down with gross asset values of zero or near zero as of year-end are not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1). However, committed capital that has not been called by certain such recently formed entities is included in the amount of regulatory assets under management in Item 5 and the information provided in Item 9. In addition, these entities are included the number of clients managed by GIM. Where applicable, regulatory assets under management and gross asset values have been converted from EURO, INR, GBP, and AUD to USD based on the 12/31/2024 Spot Rate.   In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), the total commitment amount for each private fund was used to calculate the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), a private fund’s general partner (or similar managing entity) is not counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13, and the general partner’s commitment amount is excluded when calculating the percentages for the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), where applicable, investors in a private fund who have made capital commitments but have not yet had capital called are counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), due to the structural overlap of certain private funds, separately managed accounts, and co-investment clients, GIM answered in the negative for Question 19 and indicated zero percent for Question 20 as it believes that such structural overlap does not constitute a solicitation of any such client or investment by any such client into a private fund. For purposes of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), in response to Question 28, GIM indicated “Yes” for private funds that are currently in an active fundraising period utilizing a third-party placement agent, and “No” for private funds that previously employed a third-party placement agent but whose fundraising period has ended. Global Infrastructure Partners Singapore Manager Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIM, is not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.A. This entity is a sub-manager to certain non-US private funds and separately managed accounts and receives management fees from such entities, but does not conduct any investment advisory services. GIP IV Cavalry Co-Invest II, L.P. is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). This entity is an investment-specific vehicle whose sole beneficial owner is Infra Investors II Co-Invest, L.P., a private fund listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). Global Infrastructure Partners IV-C / C2 AIV, L.P. was formed for investment structuring purposes and is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). However, its beneficial owners are investors in other Global Infrastructure Partners IV private funds, which are listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). For purposes of Item 8.A.(1), from time to time, GIM warehouses investments for certain private funds that have not been formed or have not closed when the investments are made. Once formed, GIM transfers the investments to the respective private funds pursuant to their governing documents. GIM discloses these warehousing arrangements and the corresponding risks to prospective investors within the relevant private placement memoranda. For purposes of Item 8.A.(2), certain of GIM’s principals and employees invest in the same investments as the private funds (including co-investments) through such funds’ general partner entities or dedicated “friends and family” vehicles. Certain private funds and separately managed accounts hold public securities indirectly at Caixa Bank.  For Schedule D, Section 7.A., GIM treats all BLK affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers and exempt reporting advisers as related persons. These advisers manage private funds and separately managed accounts not listed under Item 5.D. or Schedule D, Section 7.B.1. of GIM’s Form ADV.

For 80 of these clients with aggregate regulatory assets under management of $677,928,676, Capital Counsel is deemed to have custody due to active standing third-party transfer instructions. Capital Counsel complies with the seven provisions in the SEC's February 21, 2017 no-action letter and is thus exempt from undergoing surprise custody examinations for these 80 clients. Capital Counsel is deemed to have custody of the 3 remaining clients, which are pooled investment vehicles with aggregate regulatory assets under management of $359,240,779, because it is the general partner of the limited partnerships.   As reported in Item 5.B(6) and 5.L, Capital Counsel compensates a third-party for recommending clients to Capital Counsel, which constitutes a testimonial and advertisement. Capital Counsel’s public-facing marketing materials do not contain testimonials or endorsements. However, Capital Counsel understands the definition of an advertisement to include any testimonial or endorsement for which an advisor provides compensation, and as such, has elected to answer “yes” to Item 5L(1)(c) and Item 5L(2).

1977712,"Observations Regarding the Methodology for Computing Number of Clients and Accounts: Pathstone may describe or refer to advisory clients in various materials, deliverables, regulatory filings, and agreements as “client relationships”, “family relationships”, “client accounts” or “client portfolios” depending upon the context and the reporting needs. This is not a complete or exhaustive list, but rather a small sampling of the various descriptions that may be used to describe advisory clients throughout firm materials. Additionally, the firm utilizes different legacy reporting practices across certain offices resulting in unique client identifiers, names, or descriptions of advisory clients, in part due to the integration of multiple legacy organizations, portfolio accounting systems, CRM software and client reporting preferences (e.g., flash estimates, monthly, quarterly, or other periodic reporting requirements of advisory clients).  As a result, with respect to the number of clients listed in Item 5C of Pathstone’s Form Part 1A, Pathstone includes each family relationship and each Affiliated Fund in the client count but excludes limited partners of these pooled investment vehicles that are not otherwise advisory clients of Pathstone. Additionally, for purposes of Item 5C, Pathstone generally does not separately count each sub-family relationship. Sub-family relationships are often grouped together using internal criteria such as the consolidation of related individuals and family entities covered under the same periodic reports, investment policies and/or agreements. A counting of each sub-family relationship, or alternatively each account, would result in a number much higher than the actual number of family relationships. With respect to the “Total Number of Accounts” in Item 5F, Pathstone generally counts each individual custody or prime broker account for each sub-family relationship, including individuals and family-related entities; where appropriate based on the nature of a legacy acquired advisory business and reporting practices, an account reported in Item 5F refers to a single client advisory relationship that may encompass a group of related individuals or entities. One unintended outcome of this methodology is that dividing the total discretionary AUM by the number of accounts in Item 5F (or the number of clients listed in Item 5C) results in an arithmetic average of AUM for each family relationship much smaller than the actual numerical average.   Observations Regarding Treating Affiliated Funds as Advisory Clients: Pathstone also provides advisory services to its Affiliated Funds pursuant to separate agreements and as a result, each Affiliated Fund is treated as an advisory client. Pathstone assists and advises with managing certain investment and business operations of the Affiliated Funds, in each case to the extent provided in the applicable governing agreement.    Observations Regarding Certain Limited Partners of Pathstone Affiliated Funds: Certain limited partners invested in the Affiliated Funds who have no other relationship with Pathstone (i.e., they are not receiving investment advisory services pursuant to a separate agreement), may be referred to as “Limited Partners”, “LPs”, “LP Only Investors”, “Non-client Limited Partner”, etc. depending upon the reporting practices of each legacy organization. As a result, such Limited Partners are not counted as advisory clients for Item 5C.     With respect to Section 5(K) 2, the only derivative transactions Pathstone reports on are structured notes. With respect to Item 5(K)2, Pathstone's strategy is not to effect borrowing transactions, however some clients have margin accounts that would permit them to borrow either for investment or non-investment purposes.  We are not filing a Schedule R for Saltbox II, LLC or PFO/CA Fund GP LLC, which are special purpose vehicles that we believe meet the fact patterns and conditions described in the 2005 Staff letter to the American Bar Association (ABA) and described in the 2012 Staff letter to the ABA as the “2005 Conditions"".  With respect to Schedule A, Pathstone Intermediate Holdings, LLC has indicated an employer ID of 00-0000000 since the entity does not have a CRD number, tax ID or EIN.  In aggregate, pooled investment vehicles controlled and/or managed by Lovell Minnick Partners LLC (“LMP”) hold an indirect interest in Pathstone Holdings LLC of greater than 25%. However, no single LMP managed/controlled entity owns more than the 25% which would trigger disclosure. As a result and in accordance with the Schedule B’s instructions, no Lovell Minnick entities are required to be disclosed on Schedule B."

For Item 5(L)(1)(d) and 5(L)(2), the Registrant advises that its advertisements do not include endorsements.  However, the Registrant does engage a third-party marketer for Birnam Oak Offshore Fund, LP that the Registrant would pay (but has not yet paid as of the date of this filing) under specified conditions.  Because the third-party marketer's statements may be deemed to be endorsements, the Registrant has indicated that its advertisements contain endorsements.  For Item 7.B, when disclosing the beneficial owners of the feeder funds (Birnam Oak Fund, LP and Birnam Oak Offshore Fund, LP), the Registrant has included the beneficial owners of these feeder funds (including, when known to the Registrant through subscription agreements, any beneficial owners that may invest in these feeder funds through other entities) when reporting the number or percentage beneficially owned in questions 13-16 on Schedule D.  Certain of these other entities investing directly or indirectly in a feeder fund invest more than 10% of their assets in the feeder fund.  RAUM, number of investors, jurisdiction of investors and other related disclosures are based on data as of February 28, 2025.  For purposes of disclosing number of investors and jurisdiction of investors, the Registrant's disclosure is based on answers provided in subscription agreements available to it.  The Registrant counts investors based on legal name and does not endeavor to ascertain overlapping beneficial ownership of investors, nor does the Registrant generally look through legal entity investors to count underlying beneficial owners. However, certain of the Registrant's employees and related persons invest in Birnam Oak Fund, LP indirectly through an employee partnership.  The Registrant does look through this employee partnership for purposes of disclosing beneficial ownership, jurisdiction, and number of investors.  CERTAIN RESPONSES TO SCHEDULE D, SECTION7.B.(2) HAVE BEEN OMITTED AND ARE THE SUBJECT OF A REQUEST FOR CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT PENDING WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  The Registrant sub-advises a notional net and gross asset value of assets in these private fund accounts subject to confidential treatment rather than a set amount of capital.

1976253,"Observations Regarding the Methodology for Computing Number of Clients and Accounts: Pathstone may describe or refer to advisory clients in various materials, deliverables, regulatory filings, and agreements as “client relationships”, “family relationships”, “client accounts” or “client portfolios” depending upon the context and the reporting needs. This is not a complete or exhaustive list, but rather a small sampling of the various descriptions that may be used to describe advisory clients throughout firm materials. Additionally, the firm utilizes different legacy reporting practices across certain offices resulting in unique client identifiers, names, or descriptions of advisory clients, in part due to the integration of multiple legacy organizations, portfolio accounting systems, CRM software and client reporting preferences (e.g., flash estimates, monthly, quarterly, or other periodic reporting requirements of advisory clients).  As a result, with respect to the number of clients listed in Item 5C of Pathstone’s Form Part 1A, Pathstone includes each family relationship and each Affiliated Fund in the client count but excludes limited partners of these pooled investment vehicles that are not otherwise advisory clients of Pathstone. Additionally, for purposes of Item 5C, Pathstone generally does not separately count each sub-family relationship. Sub-family relationships are often grouped together using internal criteria such as the consolidation of related individuals and family entities covered under the same periodic reports, investment policies and/or agreements. A counting of each sub-family relationship, or alternatively each account, would result in a number much higher than the actual number of family relationships. With respect to the “Total Number of Accounts” in Item 5F, Pathstone generally counts each individual custody or prime broker account for each sub-family relationship, including individuals and family-related entities; where appropriate based on the nature of a legacy acquired advisory business and reporting practices, an account reported in Item 5F refers to a single client advisory relationship that may encompass a group of related individuals or entities. One unintended outcome of this methodology is that dividing the total discretionary AUM by the number of accounts in Item 5F (or the number of clients listed in Item 5C) results in an arithmetic average of AUM for each family relationship much smaller than the actual numerical average.   Observations Regarding Treating Affiliated Funds as Advisory Clients: Pathstone also provides advisory services to its Affiliated Funds pursuant to separate agreements and as a result, each Affiliated Fund is treated as an advisory client. Pathstone assists and advises with managing certain investment and business operations of the Affiliated Funds, in each case to the extent provided in the applicable governing agreement.    Observations Regarding Certain Limited Partners of Pathstone Affiliated Funds: Certain limited partners invested in the Affiliated Funds who have no other relationship with Pathstone (i.e., they are not receiving investment advisory services pursuant to a separate agreement), may be referred to as “Limited Partners”, “LPs”, “LP Only Investors”, “Non-client Limited Partner”, etc. depending upon the reporting practices of each legacy organization. As a result, such Limited Partners are not counted as advisory clients for Item 5C.     With respect to Section 5(K) 2, the only derivative transactions Pathstone reports on are structured notes. With respect to Item 5(K)2, Pathstone's strategy is not to effect borrowing transactions, however some clients have margin accounts that would permit them to borrow either for investment or non-investment purposes.  We are not filing a Schedule R for Saltbox II, LLC or PFO/CA Fund GP LLC, which are special purpose vehicles that we believe meet the fact patterns and conditions described in the 2005 Staff letter to the American Bar Association (ABA) and described in the 2012 Staff letter to the ABA as the “2005 Conditions"".  With respect to Schedule A, Pathstone Intermediate Holdings, LLC has indicated an employer ID of 00-0000000 since the entity does not have a CRD number, tax ID or EIN.  In aggregate, pooled investment vehicles controlled and/or managed by Lovell Minnick Partners LLC (“LMP”) hold an indirect interest in Pathstone Holdings LLC of greater than 25%. However, no single LMP managed/controlled entity owns more than the 25% which would trigger disclosure. As a result and in accordance with the Schedule B’s instructions, no Lovell Minnick entities are required to be disclosed on Schedule B."

The asset amounts reported in Items 5 and 9 and Section 7.B of Schedule D are as of November 1, 2024. For one or more certain private fund clients of Moontower, Moontower has determined that it has discretionary authority over such fund’s assets, notwithstanding that the investor in that fund is entitled to an “opt-out” right that allows such investor to elect not to participate in an investment made by the fund. Entities controlled by a third-party investor in Mt Carmel Bixby N LLC and Mt Carmel Bixby PI LLC, which are reported as private funds in Schedule D Section 7.B, have made an initial capital commitment to these two private funds on a combined basis. For purposes of reporting asset amounts for such funds in Section 7.B, the commitment has been allocated 50-50 between the two funds. In addition, these two funds have certain board of director members who are affiliated with a third-party investor that is invested in such private funds and who are not affiliated with Moontower. Those board of director members are not listed in response to Question 3.(a) of Section 7.B for such funds. The general partners of Moontower-advised private funds are ultimately principally owned by Russell James Valdez and Connor Ramsay Stewart, who are listed on Schedule A, and/or entities affiliated therewith. In addition, certain other Moontower personnel and/or individuals with whom the firm has a relationship are expected to have non-controlling interests in general partner entities, including for purposes of receiving a portion of the carried interest (or similar compensation) to which such entities may be entitled. Certain funds may make investments through alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) or special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) that are formed to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory or other structuring reasons. Any such AIVs and SPVs have not been separately listed in Schedule D Section 7.B, but any assets they may hold are included in the asset values reported in Section 7.B for the reported private funds to which they relate. For private fund clients with respect to which Moontower has indicated in Section 7.B that their financial statements are subject to annual audit, the audit firm reported therein has been engaged to conduct an audit of the fund’s financial statements covering the period from the date the fund first had cash or investment activity until on or after December 31, 2024.

Section 1.B. of Schedule D.: The Advisor is affiliated with other SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group (as defined herein), which have been listed on Section 1.B. of Schedule D, including Avenue Capital Management II, L.P. (CRD #111845) (""ACM2"") and Avenue Europe International Management, L.P. (CRD #131937) (""AEIM"" and, together with ACM2 and the Advisor, “Avenue Capital Group”).   Section 1.F. of Schedule D.

D:  Third-party attorneys of the Advisor hold documents evidencing indicia of ownership of certain uncertificated assets, including without limitation, private credit assets, bank debt and trade claims held by funds managed by the Advisor, which are not listed in Sec. 1.L. of Sch. D.    Sec. 1.M. of Sch. D: For clarification purposes, please note that GL Advisors Hong Kong Limited has received a Type 9 (asset management) license with the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong and is registered as a “foreign portfolio investor” with the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Avenue Asia Singapore Pte. Ltd. is the holder of a Capital Markets Services Licence issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to conduct Fund Management activities.  Items 5.A. and 5.B.(1): The figure reported in Item 5.A. reflects the employees of Avenue Capital Group as a whole, of which the Advisor is one of several affiliated registered investment advisers.  The figure reported in Item 5.B.(1) reflects only those employees who perform investment advisory functions for the Advisor itself, except that Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner, the founders of Avenue Capital Group, are included in Item 5.B.(1) on Form ADV for each registered investment adviser within Avenue Capital Group. The figures reported in Items 5.A., 5.B.(1) and 5.B.(6) are current as of April 2, 2025.

The entire value of the assets of Avenue RP is included in the regulatory assets under management of AEIM, and custody of Avenue RP's assets is attributed to AEIM.

The entire value of the assets of the Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds is included in the regulatory assets under management of ACM2, and custody of the Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds' assets is attributed to ACM2.   Sec. 7.A.(1) of Sch. D:  The Advisor has related persons who are omitted from Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D of the Advisor’s Form ADV.  As a general matter, the Advisor’s business activities do not involve such omitted related persons.  The majority of such omitted related persons are general partners and/or sub-advisers to private funds managed by other affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers within Avenue Capital Group and are listed in each such filing adviser’s respective Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D.  Rather, the Advisor has listed all general partners and managing members of its private fund clients in Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D.  While not required to do so, the Advisor has determined to voluntarily disclose such information in its own Form ADV (as opposed to Sec. 7.A. of Sch. D of the Advisor’s affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers).    In addition, SPVs created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which are wholly-owned by the Advisor and/or its affiliates are not listed in Sec. 7.A. or Sec. 7.B.(1) of Sch. D, and do not carry out substantive business activities or function as “private funds.”  In addition, an SPV created for tax and other reasons to facilitate investments and which accept investments from third-parties that are unaffiliated with the Advisor is not listed in Sec. 7.A. or Sec. 7.B.(1) of Sch. D so long as the SPV: (i) is a non-U.S. entity that does not use U.S. jurisdictional means to offer or sell its securities; or (ii) does not invest directly in securities.  The Advisor is affiliated with AMROC Investments, LLC (“AMROC”).  AMROC is not a broker-dealer of securities and is not registered with FINRA.    Sec. 7.B.(1) of Sch. D:   Q. 3(b) and 18(b): The entity set forth in response to Q. 3(a) of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has delegated all investment authority to the Advisor.  The entities set forth in response to Q. 3(b) of each Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have delegated all investment authority to the Advisor; such entities do not advise the fund(s). Entities listed in Q. 18(b), if any, provide sub-advisory services to the applicable fund, but the Advisor continues to have investment authority.  The entities listed in Schedule R act as sub-advisers to certain of the funds.  Q. 23 for Avenue Asia Employee Participation Plan II, LLC: The response to Q. 23(a) is “no” and responses to Q. 23(b-h) are left blank because this fund is not individually audited.  However, the funds that this entity invests in are affiliated funds of the Advisor and are audited annually.  Q. 27: For certain private funds, the administrator of the fund has been engaged to conduct an independent valuation analysis of a private fund’s portfolio in accordance with the fund’s valuation policies and procedures. If the Advisor’s valuation results fall within an acceptable range of the administrator’s calculations, then the Advisor’s valuation amounts are accepted by the administrator. In such instances, we have responded “0%” to Q. 27 because the administrator only affirms the Advisor’s valuations.  Sec. 7.B.(2) of Sch. D:  The Advisor, ACM2 and AEIM have entered into a global services agreement with respect to Avenue RP, Avenue Global Opportunities Fund, the Avenue Sports Opportunities Funds and Avenue Global Dislocation Opportunities Fund, pursuant to which the Advisor may provide certain advisory services with respect to such entities.  Items 8.A.(1) and 8.G.(1)-(2):   The Advisor has neither engaged in principal transactions nor received soft dollar benefits in its most recent fiscal year, but may do so in the future.  Certain non-execution products and services may be provided by executing brokers, including, without limitation, research, and capital introduction events.  There is no expectation of order flow or any agreement to ""pay up"" for these products or services, however, and the Advisor does not believe that these constitute soft dollar items. To the extent that soft dollars are used in the future, any products or services acquired using soft dollars will be consistent with Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Sch. A and B: For entities which the Advisor does not control, the Advisor does not have the required information and as such it has not been provided."
1977151,"Item 9A(1)(a) has been answered ""yes"" solely due to Pace Financial Advisors, Inc.'s maintenance of certain standing letters of authorization (""SLOAs"") executed by its clients permitting us to disburse funds to certain third parties selected by our advisory clients.
