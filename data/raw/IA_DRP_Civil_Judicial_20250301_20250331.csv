THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVES THE SEC'S CHARGES THAT WACHOVIA MISLED INVESTORS REGARDING THE LIQUIDITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS THAT IT UNDERWROTE, MARKETED AND SOLD. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA AND ANOTHER FIRM, WHOSE BROKER-DEALER OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO WACHOVIA MISREPRESENTED TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARS WERE SAFE, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT WERE COMPARABLE TO CASH OR MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT, WACHOVIA REINFORCED THE PERCEPTION OF LIQUIDITY BY ROUTINELY PURCHASING ARS FROM THE OTHER FIRM'S CUSTOMERS BETWEEN AUCTIONS, WITHOUT TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT WACHOVIA'S WILLINGNESS TO DO SO DEPENDED UPON THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE AUCTIONS. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA BECAME AWARE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT PUT THE FIRM ON NOTICE THAT THE RISK OF AUCTION FAILURES HAD MATERIALLY INCREASED. WACHOVIA, NEVERTHELESS, CONTINUED TO MARKET ARS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AS HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS. WACHOVIA FOLLOWED THE LEAD OF OTHER BROKER-DEALERS AND DECIDED TO STOP SUPPORTING AUCTIONS.

THIS CASE EVENTUALLY LED TO OTHER, VERY SIMILAR CASES (DISCUSSED BELOW). THE CLAIMS AGAINST RVK WERE COMPLETELY MERITLESS. IN RVK'S 38-YEAR HISTORY, THE FIRM HAS NEVER BEEN NAMED IN A COMPLAINT FILED BY A CLIENT. AND HERE, RVK'S FORMER CLIENT-KRS-HAS OPTED NOT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIMS. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, RVK HAS BEEN A PARTY TO FIVE NEARLY IDENTICAL CASES IN KENTUCKY. TWO OF THEM WERE DISMISSED AND ARE FINAL; TWO WERE DISMISSED AND ARE ON APPEAL; ONE IS CURRENTLY STAYED. IN THE ORIGINAL CASE (1348), THE KENTUCKY SUPREME COURT ORDERED IN JULY 2020 THAT THE COMPLAINT BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF STANDING. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, A GROUP OF PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS WHO PARTICIPATE IN KRS'S HYBRID CASH BALANCE PLAN (THE ""TIER 3"" PLAINTIFFS) AND WHO WERE REPRESENTED BY SOME OF THE SAME ATTORNEYS SOUGHT TO REVIVE THE SUIT. THE KENTUCKY ATTORNEY GENERAL (AG) ALSO SOUGHT TO INTERVENE, AND FILED A DUPLICATE CASE (CASE 590). THE TIER 3 PLAINTIFFS FILED TWO ADDITIONAL SUITS (CASE 645 AND CASE 20) THAT WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL SUIT AND THE AG'S SUIT. NONE OF THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGED ANY NEW CLAIMS AGAINST RVK. ON DECEMBER 28, 2020, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED THE PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS FROM THE ORIGINAL CASE (1348) BUT ALLOWED THE AG TO INTERVENE. IN APRIL 2023, THE KENTUCKY COURT OF APPEALS RULED THAT CASE 1348 SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. THE DISMISSAL OF CASE 1348 IS NOW FINAL. ON APRIL 8, 2024, THE OAG FILED ANOTHER NEAR-DUPLICATE NEW CASE (CASE 354), WHICH WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH CASE 590. ON MAY 1, 2024, THE COURT GRANTED RVK'S MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE AG'S CASE 590 AND DISMISSED RVK. ON JULY 3, THE COURT DISMISSED RVK FROM THE AG'S OTHER CASE (354). THE AG APPEALED THE DISMISSALS AND AGAIN SOUGHT TO AMEND ITS COMPLAINT. THE APPEAL IS ONGOING. ALSO ON MAY 1, 2024, THE COURT GRANTED RVK'S MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE TIER 3 SUIT (CASE 645). THESE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT APPEAL, AND THIS DISMISSAL IS FINAL. THE TIER 3 PLAINTIFFS' OTHER SUIT WAS FILED IN 2021, AND IS (RELEVANT TO RVK) MATERIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE OTHER SUITS EXCEPT IT WAS FILED AS A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION. THIS ACTION WAS REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT, AND HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING THE STATE LITIGATION. FOR ITS PART, KPPA RETAINED AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM (CALCATERRA POLLACK LLP) IN NOVEMBER 2020 TO INVESTIGATE AND ISSUE A REPORT.

THE FIRM FOUND NO ""INDICIA OF COLLUSIONS, COVER UP, OR FIDUCIARY FAILURE"" BY RVK, AND FOUND NO ""VIOLATIONS OF FIDUCIARY DUTY OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY"" BY RVK. THE FULL REPORT IS AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://TINYURL.COM/4YNKAH6F.

THIS CASE EVENTUALLY LED TO OTHER, VERY SIMILAR CASES (DISCUSSED BELOW). THE CLAIMS AGAINST RVK WERE COMPLETELY MERITLESS. IN RVK'S 38-YEAR HISTORY, THE FIRM HAS NEVER BEEN NAMED IN A COMPLAINT FILED BY A CLIENT. AND HERE, RVK'S FORMER CLIENT-KRS-HAS OPTED NOT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIMS. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, RVK HAS BEEN A PARTY TO FIVE NEARLY IDENTICAL CASES IN KENTUCKY. TWO OF THEM WERE DISMISSED AND ARE FINAL; TWO WERE DISMISSED AND ARE ON APPEAL; ONE IS CURRENTLY STAYED. IN THE ORIGINAL CASE (1348), THE KENTUCKY SUPREME COURT ORDERED IN JULY 2020 THAT THE COMPLAINT BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF STANDING. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, A GROUP OF PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS WHO PARTICIPATE IN KRS'S HYBRID CASH BALANCE PLAN (THE ""TIER 3"" PLAINTIFFS) AND WHO WERE REPRESENTED BY SOME OF THE SAME ATTORNEYS SOUGHT TO REVIVE THE SUIT. THE KENTUCKY ATTORNEY GENERAL (AG) ALSO SOUGHT TO INTERVENE, AND FILED A DUPLICATE CASE (CASE 590). THE TIER 3 PLAINTIFFS FILED TWO ADDITIONAL SUITS (CASE 645 AND CASE 20) THAT WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE ORIGINAL SUIT AND THE AG'S SUIT. NONE OF THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGED ANY NEW CLAIMS AGAINST RVK. ON DECEMBER 28, 2020, THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED THE PRIVATE PLAINTIFFS FROM THE ORIGINAL CASE (1348) BUT ALLOWED THE AG TO INTERVENE. IN APRIL 2023, THE KENTUCKY COURT OF APPEALS RULED THAT CASE 1348 SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. THE DISMISSAL OF CASE 1348 IS NOW FINAL. ON APRIL 8, 2024, THE OAG FILED ANOTHER NEAR-DUPLICATE NEW CASE (CASE 354), WHICH WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH CASE 590. ON MAY 1, 2024, THE COURT GRANTED RVK'S MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE AG'S CASE 590 AND DISMISSED RVK. ON JULY 3, THE COURT DISMISSED RVK FROM THE AG'S OTHER CASE (354). THE AG APPEALED THE DISMISSALS AND AGAIN SOUGHT TO AMEND ITS COMPLAINT. THE APPEAL IS ONGOING. ALSO ON MAY 1, 2024, THE COURT GRANTED RVK'S MOTION TO DISMISS IN THE TIER 3 SUIT (CASE 645). THESE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT APPEAL, AND THIS DISMISSAL IS FINAL. THE TIER 3 PLAINTIFFS' OTHER SUIT WAS FILED IN 2021, AND IS (RELEVANT TO RVK) MATERIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE OTHER SUITS EXCEPT IT WAS FILED AS A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION. THIS ACTION WAS REMOVED TO FEDERAL COURT, AND HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING THE STATE LITIGATION. FOR ITS PART, KPPA RETAINED AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM (CALCATERRA POLLACK LLP) IN NOVEMBER 2020 TO INVESTIGATE AND ISSUE A REPORT. AFTER RECEIPT OF THE REPORT, KPPA'S BOARD VOTED ON MAY 26, 2021, NOT TO ""INTERVENE AS A PLAINTIFF IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S AMENDED COMPLAINT"" OR ""FILE ANY LITIGATION AGAINST ANY PARTY . . . AT THIS TIME."" THE REPORT STATED THAT AFTER EXAMINING 192,000 DOCUMENTS, REVIEWING BOARD MEETING MATERIALS AND RECORDINGS, AND CONDUCTING SEVERAL INTERVIEWS, THE FIRM CONCLUDED THAT RVK ""MET [ITS] CONTRACTUAL AND FIDUCIARY DUTIES,"" ""HONESTLY DISCLOS[ED] THE INVESTMENT CHALLENGES KRS FACED,"" AND ""SERVED AS A VALUABLE CONSULTANT."" THE FIRM FOUND NO ""INDICIA OF COLLUSIONS, COVER UP, OR FIDUCIARY FAILURE"" BY RVK, AND FOUND NO ""VIOLATIONS OF FIDUCIARY DUTY OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY"" BY RVK. THE FULL REPORT IS AVAILABLE AT HTTPS://TINYURL.COM/4YNKAH6F.  FROM THE FILING OF THE FIRST SUIT TO NOW, RVK HAS MAINTAINED THAT OUR FIRM'S YEARS OF SERVICE TO KRS WERE THOROUGHLY PROFESSIONAL, HIGHLY TRANSPARENT, AND ALWAYS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONTRACTUAL AND FIDUCIARY DUTIES."

THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVES THE SEC'S CHARGES THAT WACHOVIA MISLED INVESTORS REGARDING THE LIQUIDITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS THAT IT UNDERWROTE, MARKETED AND SOLD. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA AND ANOTHER FIRM, WHOSE BROKER-DEALER OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO WACHOVIA MISREPRESENTED TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARS WERE SAFE, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT WERE COMPARABLE TO CASH OR MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT, WACHOVIA REINFORCED THE PERCEPTION OF LIQUIDITY BY ROUTINELY PURCHASING ARS FROM THE OTHER FIRM'S CUSTOMERS BETWEEN AUCTIONS, WITHOUT TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT WACHOVIA'S WILLINGNESS TO DO SO DEPENDED UPON THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE AUCTIONS. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA BECAME AWARE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT PUT THE FIRM ON NOTICE THAT THE RISK OF AUCTION FAILURES HAD MATERIALLY INCREASED. WACHOVIA, NEVERTHELESS, CONTINUED TO MARKET ARS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AS HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS. WACHOVIA FOLLOWED THE LEAD OF OTHER BROKER-DEALERS AND DECIDED TO STOP SUPPORTING AUCTIONS.

WACHOVIA'S BUYBACK HAS TWO PHASES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, WHICH ENDED ON NOV. 28, 2008, WACHOVIA OFFERED TO PURCHASE ARS HELD BY NATURAL PERSONS, NOT-FOR-PROFIT AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND FOR OTHER ACCOUNTS WITH ACCOUNT VALUES OR HOUSEHOLD VALUES UP TO $10 MILLION.

WACHOVIA WILL COMPENSATE CUSTOMERS WHO TOOK OUT LOANS FROM WACHOVIA AFTER FEB. 13, 2008, BECAUSE OF LIQUIDITY CONCERNS BY REIMBURSING CUSTOMERS FOR NO LESS THAN THE NEGATIVE CARRY ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SUCH LOANS.
