CONCURRENT WITH THOSE TERMINATIONS, AMCA REQUIRED THE CLIENTS OF THE IDENTIFIED DEALERS TO REDEEM THEIR FUND UNITS (THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS). THE BCSC AND AMCA SETTLED ON THE BASIS THAT THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS DEPRIVED THE IMPACTED UNITHOLDERS OF THE OPTION TO CONTINUE TO HOLD THE SECURITY THAT THEY PURCHASED. THIS WAS UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO PURCHASED THE FUNDS RELYING ON DISCLOSURE THAT THEY WERE SUITABLE FOR INVESTORS WITH LONG TERM TIME HORIZON. THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS MAY HAVE CAUSED FINANCIAL HARM TO CERTAIN IMPACTED UNITHOLDERS. AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIVITY, AMCA FAILED TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH THE UNITHOLDERS AND THEREFORE CONTRAVENED SECTION 14 OF THE SECURITIES RULES (BRITISH COLUMBIA). OTHER FACTORS RELEVANT TO THE SETTLEMENT ARE THAT AMCA DID NOT PROFIT OR RECEIVE AN ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE FROM THE REQUIRED REDEMPTIONS.
