CERTAIN GROUP COMPANIES, TOGETHER WITH OTHER PANEL BANKS, HAVE ALSO BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN PRIVATE LAWSUITS, INCLUDING PURPORTED CLASS ACTION SUITS, IN THE US IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR ROLES AS PANEL BANKS CONTRIBUTING TO THE SETTING OF US DOLLAR LIBOR. THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN ASSERTED BY PLAINTIFFS CLAIMING TO HAVE HAD AN INTEREST IN VARIOUS TYPES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LINKED TO US DOLLAR LIBOR.

THE DISTRICT COURT HAS ORDERED THE CONSOLIDATION OF NEARLY ALL OF THESE ACTIONS AND HAS RECENTLY SET DEADLINES FOR THE PLAINTIFFS TO FILE THEIR CONSOLIDATED AMENDED COMPLAINT AND FOR THE DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING THE GROUP, TO MOVE TO DISMISS THESE CLAIMS.    IT IS CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE SCOPE AND ULTIMATE OUTCOME ON THE GROUP OF THE VARIOUS REGULATORY INVESTIGATIONS, PRIVATE LAWSUITS OR ANY RELATED CHALLENGES TO THE INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY OF ANY OF THE GROUP'S CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THEIR TIMING AND SCALE."
