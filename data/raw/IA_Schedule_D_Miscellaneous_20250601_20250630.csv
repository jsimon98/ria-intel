Certain such clients of the Adviser may engage in principal transactions from time to time with other affiliates.  The Adviser generally does not recommend or direct these transactions.  To the extent it does so, it would comply with applicable requirements for principal transactions. Likewise, certain affiliates of the Adviser invest for their own account and may, as a result, buy or sell securities that the Adviser purchases or sells, or recommends for purchase or sale, for clients."
1997378,"The minimum investment commitment indicated for any private fund may be reduced in the discretion of the applicable general partner or the registrant.   Certain advisory clients are structured as a fund established for a single investor or a group of affiliated investors and for purposes of Form ADV Part 1A are treated (i) as a pooled investment vehicle and (ii) as a private fund to the extent it relies on either of the exemptions provided by 3(c)1 or 3(c)7 of the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940.  Certain private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D hold certain investments through, or in parallel with, special purpose holding companies or alternative investment vehicles organized to address tax, regulatory or structural considerations in connection with certain transactions. With respect to Item 27 of section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D, as a manager of real estate fund-of-funds, the registrant relies heavily on the valuations provided by the underlying private investment fund managers. The registrant conducts independent due diligence to gain comfort with the values provided and the assumptions and conditions used to generate the fair market values of the underlying private investment fund’s asset and liabilities. The registrant has the ability to make fair market value adjustments, but has only done so in limited circumstances since inception.   Certain private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D (the “Global Funds”) were established specifically to solely invest in two or more other private funds of the registrant. Because the Global Funds do not invest in a single master fund, they are not identified as feeder funds for purposes of section 7.B.(1) of this Schedule D. Further, the allocable portion of gross asset amounts provided for each such private fund also will be reflected in the gross asset amount for the relevant other private funds of the registrant in which they invest. Additionally, for purposes of reporting the ownership information for the underlying private funds of the registrant in which such Global Funds hold an interest, the registrant has looked through such Global Funds to their respective limited partners as if they invested directly in the private funds of the registrant.   Certain of the private funds listed in section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D have limited partners which are themselves pooled investment vehicles established and controlled by a third party not affiliated with the registrant.  While any such vehicle may have invested all, or substantially all, of its assets into the private fund, the registrant deems such vehicles to be “funds-of-funds” rather than a “feeder fund” for purposes section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D.  With respect to the registrant’s regulatory assets under management and gross asset values that consist of interests in underlying private investment funds or vehicles managed by third-party investment managers, the fair market value of such interests as of December 31, 2021 is based on the latest available valuations of such interests as provided by such third-party investment managers as of September 30, 2021, plus the net cash flows (i.e., capital calls and distributions) since such date, up to and including December 31, 2021. All non-USD based cash flows and fair market values have been converted from the actual relevant currency to USD using fx rates as of December 31, 2021.   None of the registrant’s private funds or other advisory clients currently trade commodity interests.

Due to various investment structures globally, Hines has an extensive number of affiliates serving as General Partners, managing members or similar as necessary for certain real estate operating companies (each a ""REOC"" developing or operating physical real estate) and other that pertain to the governance of those legal structures.  There are a large number of these entities, and they are generally not considered to be clients of the advisor.

In addition, each REOC has a dedicated general partner for its structure.

1999884,"•	Item 5.K.(3): Schwab holds approximately 74% of our regulatory assets under management. Fidelity holds approximately 20% of our regulatory assets under management. The Company believes that the leverage it has with these custodians has allowed the Company to obtain cost effectiveness, execution efficiencies, and high levels of client service that are beneficial to clients. Also, in our experience, Schwab and Fidelity generally offer the lowest cost execution and the greatest number of resources directly to clients. •	Item 9.A(2), 9.B(2), and 9.C(3): There are circumstances where one of the officers of the Company serves as trustee for a client's trust account with the traditional authorities that come with such a role. In those circumstances, the Company has custody of such trust assets.  In addition, in circumstances where clients utilize the Company’s personal affairs management services (which often include bill paying services), the Company has custody of client assets.  Because of the implications of custody in such circumstances, and consistent with the Investment Advisers Act and the rules thereunder, the Company retains an independent accounting firm to perform an annual surprise examination to independently verify the existence and safekeeping of these client assets. Separately, there are instances where a client has executed a standing letter of authorization (SLOA), directing the Company to make payments from the client’s account to third parties (for example, to pay certain monthly or annual bills of the client with funds from the client’s investment account). While the client always specifies the payee, it is sometimes the case that the specific amount and/or specific timing of the payment is purposefully (and at the client’s direction) left open-ended (for instance, to allow the Company the administrative flexibility to pay a routine bill in an amount that may vary from payment period to payment period).  Consistent with the industry-wide guidance of the SEC Staff in the Division of Investment Management (hereinafter the “Staff”), issued in February 2017, the Company technically has “custody” (as that term is defined under the Investment Advisers Act) of assets that are subject to SLOAs with “open-ended” terms.  The Company’s response to Item 9.A(2) of Form ADV Part 1 includes these assets.  The majority of assets listed in Item 9.A(2) are assets subject to these type of SLOAs.  Consistent with the no-action letter issued by the Staff to the Investment Advisers Association on February 21, 2017 (hereinafter the “IAA Letter”) and related FAQs issued by the Staff; however, the Company is not subject to a surprise examination of the assets subject only to the SLOAs because the Company meets the requirements of the Letter: (1) the client provides a written, signed instruction to the qualified custodian (typically the broker-dealer) that includes the third-party’s name and address or account number at the custodian; (2) the client authorizes the Company in writing to direct transfers to the third party; (3) the client’s qualified custodian verifies the client’s authorization and provides a transfer of funds notice to the client promptly after each transfer; (4) the client can terminate or change the instructions; (5) the Company has no authority or ability to designate or change the identity of the third party; (6) the adviser maintains records showing that the third party is not a related party of the Company or located at the same address as the Company; and (7) the client’s qualified custodian sends the client, in writing, an initial notice confirming the instruction and an annual notice reconfirming the instruction. As specified above, however, the Company does obtain a surprise examination relative to assets where a related party (in all cases, an individual officer of the Company) serves as trustee or where the Company provides personal affairs management services.  We want to be transparent that the scope of that surprise examination does not include assets only captured in the custody definition due to the existence of a SLOA. The Company’s response to Item 9.B(2) of Form ADV Part 1 includes instances where one of the officers of the Company serves as trustee for a client's trust account or where clients utilize the Company’s personal affairs management services."

1999863,"With respect to our answers submitted in response to Question 23 of Item 7.B.(1), please note the following: (1) The majority of Oxford’s funds do not receive audited financials in accordance with GAAP, as Oxford has elected to perform income tax basis audits on these funds. To comply with the requirements of the Custody Rule, these funds undergo surprise custody audits by an independent CPA firm. An audit that follows the income tax basis of accounting, generally commences once the tax return is completed, because this would reflect the timing in which the K-1s are received from the underlying asset managers. As a result, the audit generally occurs following the completion of a fund's tax return and will not occur within 120 days of the respective fund’s fiscal year end (180 days in the case of a fund of funds),as required under the Custody Rule.   (2) A 2024 audit will not be conducted for the following funds because there was no activity or assets in the funds in 2024:  EXETER PARTNERSHIP 2024, LLC and REGENT STREET PARTNERS FUND 2025, LLC. With regard to question 23(g) in Item 7.B.(1), we have answered yes for the aforementioned funds as the financial statements for the most recently completed fiscal year will be distributed to investors.

1999178,"In response to Section 7.B.(1), Lowe, Brockenbrough & Company, Inc. (“Brockenbrough”) has provided information for each of the private funds for which it is engaged as the investment advisor. Bespoke Capital Strategies, LP (“BCS”) is a Delaware series limited partnership with seven distinct series in which a limited partner can invest. Six of the seven series are components in mini-master feeder structures, wherein the tax-exempt series serve as feeder funds to the corresponding master taxable series. Please note that because of their role as a master series in this mini-master feeder structure, the assets of taxable series do include the tax-exempt investment as well. Each of the seven series are displayed in Section 7.B.(1) as separate private funds as they each have and maintain separate books and records. Bespoke Private Strategies, LP (“BPS”) is a Delaware series limited partnership with twenty-eight distinct series to which a limited partner can commit capital. These are closed-end structures organized by vintage year that accept, or previously accepted, capital commitments for a designated period of time, before closing to new investors. Each of the twenty-eight aforementioned series are considered feeder funds and are aggregated into one or more master series through which all investments are made. For example, the Bespoke Private Strategies, LP – Series Taxable 2014 and Bespoke Private Strategies, LP – Series Tax-Exempt 2014 are feeder funds for the Bespoke Private Strategies, LP – Series Master 2014. Each of the feeder funds and master funds are listed as separate private funds in Section 7.B.(1). The format of the ADV does not allow for more than one master series to be attributed to a feeder fund. Please note the following series have more than one master series: Series Taxable 2015 (Series Master 2015 and Real Estate Series Master 2015), Series Tax-Exempt 2015 (Series Master 2015 and Real Estate Series Master 2015), Series Taxable 2016 (Series Master 2016 and Real Estate Series Master 2016), Series Tax-Exempt 2016 (Series Master 2016 and Real Estate Series Master 2016), Series Taxable 2019 (Series Master 2019 and Real Estate Series Master 2019), Series Tax-Exempt 2019 (Series Master 2019 and Real Estate Series Master 2019), Series Taxable 2020 (Series Master 2020 and Real Assets Series Master 2020), and Series Tax-Exempt 2020 (Series Master 2020 and Real Assets Series Master 2020), Series Taxable 2022 (Series Master 2022 and Real Asset Series Master 2022), and Series Tax-Exempt 2022 (Series Master 2022 and Real Asset Series Master 2022).   Regulatory Assets Under Management: For purposes of Items 5.D and 5.F, Brockenbrough has separately managed account relationships with certain clients where the client has invested in pooled investment vehicles managed by Brockenbrough. The firm has reported these assets in Item 5.D and 5.F as regulatory assets under management with respect to its relationships as a separately managed account adviser and pooled investment vehicle adviser. This results in redundant accounting of certain assets in the calculation of regulatory assets under management, but provides accurate information about how Brockenbrough manages separately managed accounts in Section 5.K. of Schedule D. Additionally, the assets of the affiliated private funds include $301,977,690 of unfunded commitments. Certain client relationships for whom we have a discretionary investment management agreement have been deemed to be non-discretionary for purposes of calculating regulatory assets under management. In these cases, clients include those for whom we provide recommendations and facilitate the execution of investments on the client’s behalf. Using margin or borrowing is not a part of our investment strategy with respect to separately managed account clients. Certain clients do utilize borrowing or margin. Consistent with the way Brockenbrough reports to these clients, regulatory assets under management reflect the balances net of any margin or borrowing balances."

1996631,"As described in the Part 2A of the Registrant’s Form ADV, the Registrant currently provides advice with respect to infrastructure assets to: (i) AC in relation to AC’s administration of the OMERS primary pension plan and (ii) third party co-investors in certain Co-Investment Programs. The foregoing is for informational purposes and is also in response to Item 5.G.(12). As of December 31, 2024, the net assets of the OMERS primary pension plan was approximately CAD$138 billion or USD$96 billion, all of which were administered by AC. An amount of those assets, as determined by the OMERS Board, is allocated for potential infrastructure investments. Item 1.F: From time to time, the associated persons of OMERS Infrastructure may conduct their US advisory activities from affiliated offices in the United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Amsterdam and Australia. Items 5.A. and B.: We have included associated persons of the Registrant employed by related persons of the Registrant. Item 5.F.: In determining our regulatory assets under management, we do not deduct any outstanding indebtedness or other accrued but unpaid liabilities of pooled investment vehicles or pension and profit sharing plans, but note that for purposes of this filing, indebtedness and/or other accrued but unpaid liabilities have been deducted in calculating the equity value of portfolio companies held by such clients. Items 5.D.(3)(f) and (g), 9.A.(2)(a) and 9.B.(2)(a): In calculating the dollar value of its assets under management for purposes of Items 5.D.(3)(f) and (g), and 9.A.(2)(a). and 9.B.(2)(a), the Registrant has included only amounts invested in infrastructure assets advised by the Registrant, and has not included any uninvested capital from the OMERS primary pension plan or Co-Investors. To avoid the double counting of assets, for purposes of that calculation, the Registrant has excluded from the calculation of the assets attributable to pension and profit sharing plans referenced in Item 5.D.(3)(g), the assets of the OMERS primary pension plan that have been invested in the pooled investment vehicle referenced in Item 5.D.(3)(f).  In addition, for purposes of identifying the types of clients advised by the Registrant in Item 5.D.(1), the Registrant has deemed those vehicles that hold only assets of the OMERS primary pension plan to be pension and profit sharing plans, and those vehicles that hold assets invested by the OMERS primary pension plan and Co-Investors as pooled investment vehicles. Item 5.E.(7) Other (specify): The Registrant receives a management fee from its parent on a cost recovery basis plus 7% on certain of these costs. Some investors paid a one-time upfront fee. Items 5.F.(2) and 8.C.(1)-(2): As described in Item 16 of Part 2A of the Registrant’s Form ADV, the Registrant does not consider itself to have discretionary authority over Co-Investor assets. For purposes of calculating the number “accounts” or “clients” advised by the Registrant in Items 5.C.(2), 5.F.(2)(d)-(f), and 9.A.(2)(b) and 9.B.(2)(b), the Registrant has collectively deemed those vehicles that hold only assets of the OMERS primary pension plan to be a single non-United States account or client, and those vehicles that hold assets invested by the OMERS primary pension plan and Co-Investors as pooled investment vehicles. Item 9.B (1) and (2) were completed since related persons of the Registrant are deemed to have custody due to contractual authorizations, but they do not have physical custody of the assets. Item 9.F. and Section 7.B.(1) 25(a)-(g): custodian relationship information is as of January 31, 2024. Schedule B - Indirect Owners: some indirect owners acquired shares in a class of securities more than once. In such cases, we have listed the date of the first acquisition of such shares. Section 7.B.(1) 3.(a): The Management Board of Borealis Ark Holdings B.V. consists of two OMERS employees and/or one advisor, including two Dutch residents. For purposes of Items 13 and 14 in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the responses exclude a 51% voting (non-economic) interest in a private fund held by an affiliate of OMERS Infrastructure US Limited.

1988397,"Most, if not all, of AmeriFlex®’s investment advisory representatives (""IARs"") are concurrently registered as “registered representatives” of SagePoint Financial, Inc. (“SagePoint”), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC and a registered investment advisory firm (CRD No. 133763) (each a “Dually Registered Person”). SagePoint is not otherwise affiliated with our firm. Clients can enter into a separate commission-based arrangement with such individuals (but not with AmeriFlex® directly) and SagePoint for securities brokerage services (a “Brokerage Arrangement”). Investments made through the Brokerage Relationship may be separate from the advisory services we provide to you, and therefore, AmeriFlex® does not have a fiduciary duty over such Brokerage Relationship recommendations.   Under the foregoing arrangement, these Dually Registered Persons, acting in their capacity as registered representatives of SagePoint, may receive commissions, ongoing distribution fees (i.e., trails), and other compensation based on sales of securities to clients. This creates a conflict of interest insofar as such Dually Registered Persons may have a financial incentive to sell securities to clients for which they may collect commissions. Alternatively, they may have an incentive to forego providing you with advisory services when appropriate, and instead recommend the purchase of commissionable investments, if they deem that the payout for recommending the purchase of these investments would be higher than providing management advice on these products for an advisory fee. Clients are advised that fees paid to AmeriFlex® for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the commissions and/or other forms of compensation that may be earned by any Dually Registered Persons for selling securities products to clients through SagePoint.   The receipt of securities related commissions by an individual associated with the firm presents a conflict of interest. As fiduciaries we must act primarily for the benefit of our investment advisory clients. As such, we will only transact securities related business with clients when fully disclosed, suitable, and appropriate.  Further, we must determine in good faith that any commissions paid to our representatives and affiliates are appropriate. Clients are informed that they are under no obligation to use any individual associated with our firm for the purchase of securities products or services. Clients may use any broker-dealer they choose for purchase of these products and services. We encourage you to ask us about the conflicts of interest presented by the dual registration of our IARs.  Certain of our Advisory Affiliates are licensed insurance agencies and/or some of our IARs are independently licensed on an individual basis to sell insurance in one or more states acting as direct agent representatives of a specific insurance company or companies. Insurance related business is transacted with advisory clients and licensed individuals may receive commissions from insurance products sold to clients. Clients are advised that the fees paid to AmeriFlex® for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the commissions earned by any individual (or insurance agency) for selling insurance products to clients. If requested by a client, we will disclose the amount of commissions expected to be paid.   The receipt of insurance related commissions by any individual or Advisory Affiliate associated with AmeriFlex® presents a conflict of interest. As fiduciaries we must act primarily for the benefit of our investment advisory clients. As such, we will only transact insurance related business with clients when fully disclosed, suitable, and appropriate.  Further, we must determine in good faith that any commissions paid to our representatives and affiliates are appropriate. Clients are informed that they are under no obligation to use any individual associated with our firm for the purchase of insurance products or services. Clients may use any insurance firm or agent they choose for purchase of these products and services.

1994721,"FOR PURPOSES OF 13,15 AND 16 OF SECTION 7.B.(1)(A) WITH RESPECT TO NEWBROOK CAPITAL OFFSHORE FUND LTD. AND NEWBROOK CAPITAL PARTNERS LP, A NOMINEE IS COUNTED AS A SINGLE INVESTOR REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY SUBSCRIBERS ON BEHALF OF WHICH IT MAY BE SUBSCRIBING."
1997695,"In Section 1.L. we have treated data stored in cloud-based servers that is accessible from our office (such as Global Relay) as being located in our office.   In Item 5.A., ""employees"" includes principals of the management company.    For the purpose of determining the number of firm ""clients"" in Item 5, we are including entities that may receive investment advice that is different (in whole or in part) from the investment advice given to another managed entity, except as further qualified below.  Hudson Bay International Fund Ltd. (the “Multi-Strat Offshore Feeder Fund”), Hudson Bay International Levered Fund Ltd. (the “Levered Feeder Fund”) and Hudson Bay Fund LP (the “Multi-Strat Onshore Feeder Fund,” and, collectively with the Multi-Strat Offshore Feeder Fund and the Levered Feeder Fund, the “Multi-Strat Funds”) are each hardwired into Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd. (the “Multi-Strat Master Fund”) and do not exercise investment discretion at the feeder level and we are therefore not currently counting them as clients separate from the Multi-Strat Master Fund. The Multi-Strat Onshore Feeder Fund invests most of its investable assets into the Multi-Strat Master Fund and invests the remainder of its investable assets in HB Fund LLC, which is counted as a separate client.  Hudson Bay Capital Structure Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. (the “Cap Structure Master Fund”) has a single feeder fund, Hudson Bay Cap Structure Arbitrage Enhanced Fund LP, and HBC Real Estate Fund II LLC (the “Real Estate Opportunities Fund”) has  a single feeder fund, Hudson Bay Real Estate Opportunities Fund LP. Given the current structure, it is unlikely that either of these feeder funds would ever trade independently of their master funds and we are therefore counting each of the Cap Structure Master Fund and the Real Estate Opportunities Fund as a single client. The Hudson Bay Special Opportunities Fund consists of a structure in which three feeder funds (the “Special Opps Feeders”) each invests into four master funds (the “Special Opps Masters,”) and a stand alone alternative investment vehicle (“AIV”) in which all the investors in the Special Opps Feeders, exclusive of one investor, invest directly (the Special Opps Feeders, the Special Opps Masters and the AIV, collectively, the “Special Opps Fund”).  Investments are allocated to the appropriate Special Opps Master based on tax considerations.  Because this is marketed and sold as one investment product, the Special Opps Fund is counted as one client.  Three of the four Special Opps Masters are non-US entities. Accordingly, for the purpose of answering Item 5.C.(2), the Special Opps Fund is counted as a non-US Person.  Despite being counted as only one client, each of the Special Opps Masters, along with the AIV, is listed on its own Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. For purposes of answering the gross asset value of each Special Opps Master and the AIV, we are treating gross asset value as regulatory assets under management (which includes committed but uncalled capital).  Because commitments are made at each Special Opps Feeder level and can be called into any Special Opps Master, the uncalled commitments from Special Opps investors has been attributed to the gross asset value for each of the Special Opps Master Funds. The AIV’s gross asset value is the aggregate committed capital of all its indirect investors (which is the same as the Special Opps Feeders investors, absent one investor). HBC Real Estate Fund LLC (the “REIT”) is a subsidiary of the Multi-Strat Master Fund and HB Fund, but also has certain outside investors who hold preferred shares.  Accordingly, it is counted as a separate client. Based on the above methodology, as of the 2024 annual ADV filing, Hudson Bay had 7 clients: (i) the Multi-Strat Master Fund; (ii) HB Fund LLC; (iii) the Cap Structure Master Fund; (iv) the Real Estate Opportunities Fund; (v) the Hudson Bay Insurance Dedicated Fund (the “IDF”); (vi) the Special Opps Fund; and (vii) the REIT. For purposes of answering Item 5.F., we are interpreting “Accounts” to mean “clients.”  For purposes of Item 5.F.3. (regulatory assets under management attributable to non-U.S. persons), we are treating offshore master funds as non-U.S. persons and are not looking through to the feeder funds.    In situations where a Hudson Bay fund has a cross investment in another Hudson Bay Fund, we count such investments in each individual Fund’s GAV for purposes of answering Question 11 of Section 7.B.(1) on Schedule D, but in order to avoid double counting for purposes of calculating firm-wide RAUM (Item 5.F.), we count such cross investments only once.  In such cases, the sum total of all the Hudson Bay Funds’ GAV is greater than the firm-wide RAUM.  For example, the Special Opps Fund has an arrangement with the Multi-Strat Funds whereby Multi-Strat Fund investors can “flex” their capital from the Multi-Strat Fund to the Special Opps Fund to meet capital calls.  Accordingly, the capital subject to the “flex” arrangement that is in the Multi-Strat Funds is counted separately towards the RAUM of each of the Multi-Strat Master Fund and the Special Opps Fund, but only counted once for firm-wide RAUM.  We have not included certain ""related persons"" in Item 7.A. that do not fall into any of the categories designated by items (1) through (16).  Such entities include Hudson Bay Capital GP LLC, which is the general partner of Hudson Bay Capital Management LP; Hudson Bay International Associates LLC and Hudson Bay Special Shareholder LLC, which are special shareholders of the Intermediate Fund; and Hudson Bay Capital Management (UK) Ltd, which is the corporate member of Hudson Bay Capital UK LLP. We have also not included dormant entities, as they are not providing “advisory services.”     The REIT is a captive fund within the Multi-Strat Funds’ structure whose equity is owned by Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd. and HB Fund LLC.  In order to meet certain regulatory requirements, there are 125 outside investors who hold preferred shares directly in the REIT (the “Preferred Shareholders”).  For purposes of the answering the ownership questions of Schedule D, Section 7(B)(1) (questions 12-16), we are counting each of the Preferred Shareholders and each of the Feeders as an owner, but are not looking through the feeders to their underlying investors, as that investor information is included in the schedule for Hudson Bay Master Fund Ltd.  The REIT invests all its assets into a trading vehicle, HBC Real Estate Holdings I LLC (the “REIT SPV”), which itself invests in real estate instruments.  For purposes of answering question 8 of Schedule D, Section 7(B)(1), we are looking through the REIT’s investment in the REIT SPV in order to determine whether the REIT is a fund of funds.  For the purpose of answering Question 8 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (does the fund invest 10% or more of its total assets in other pooled investment vehicles) we are excluding special purpose vehicles in which all owners are entities within the same fund complex.  For the purpose of answering Question 13 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (number of beneficial owners), we count joint accounts as having a single owner.  For the purpose of answering Question 14 of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (% of the fund owned by you and your “related persons”), we have included family members, related parties of Related Persons and private funds managed by the adviser as Related Persons.  With respect to Question 18.(b) of Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the Multi-Strat Funds have a subadvisory agreement with High Trail Capital, which is a non-discretionary arrangement, whereby High Trail presents Hudson Bay with certain investment opportunities, but Hudson Bay retains full investment discretion.    For the purpose of answering Question 20 in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D (% of clients investing in the fund) for all funds, we have: (i) disregarded the fund at issue; and (ii) collapsed all feeders into their master.  As a result, for purposes of this filing, we have 7 potential clients: (i) the Master Fund; (ii) HB Fund LLC ; (iii) the Cap Structure Master Fund; (iv) the Real Estate Fund Opportunities Fund; (v) the IDF; (vi) the Special Opps Fund; and (vii) the REIT.  Excluding the fund itself, the denominator in the calculation will always be 6.  The REIT is treated as investing in the Multi-Strat Master Fund, as it is embedded within the Multi-Strat Fund complex.   The Real Estate Opportunities Fund launched in 2025 and therefore, using 12/31 values, the value of all total asset related questions is 0.  For the purpose of answering Item 9, we have used regulatory assets under management (RAUM). We deem our custody to be held through our related persons (such as the general partner of certain feeder funds), and therefore list all custodied assets under 9.B.(2). Because the methodology to calculate the number of “clients” we use here focuses on custody, rather than independent investment advice methodology used to answer Item 5, the total number of firm “clients” differs in Items 5 and 9. The methodology used here is based on different investor groups, with the clients being: (i) Multi-Strat Offshore; (ii) Multi-Strat Onshore; (iii) Real Estate Opportunities Fund; (iv) HB Fund LLC; (v) Cap Structure Fund; (vi) IDF; (vii) REIT and (viii-x) the Special Opps Feeder Funds.  For the purpose of answering Item 9.F. (number of qualified custodians), we count an institution and all of its affiliates as a single custodian (i.e., UBS Securities and UBS AG)."
1996114,"Item 5.C(1): The number of clients reported here includes adviser’s clients who are financial planning only clients with no assets under management. These clients are also included in the total number of financial planning clients reported in Item 5.H.....    Item 5.K.(3): JSF Financial LLC uses the custodial services of Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions( FCCS)as well as National Financial Services (NFS).  FCCS is a subsidiary of NFS and utilizes the identical SEC registration number and CRD numbers.  Thus although we attempted to complete two separate entries, the ADV system lists both as National Financial Services.  The entries should read:  National Financial Services              AUM    12,257,097 Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions  AUM 1,717,096,484  Item 9(C): JSF Financial is deemed to have custody of certain clients that have Standing Letters of Authorization on file with their custodians to allow JSF Financial to initiate transfers of money on the clients behalf.

1999493,"The Adviser has supplied all Advisory Client related data herein as of 12/31/2024. ------------------------------------------ BTG Pactual Asset Management US, LLC, and BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, LLC, are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC No-Action Letter addressed to the American Bar Association, Business Law Section dated January 18, 2012 (the ""ABA Letter"").  The following affiliate is filing as a relying adviser as defined in the ABA Letter: BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, LLC. ------------------------------------------ In response to Items 5(A) and 5(B), the Adviser has included the number of employees as of the fiscal year end. Employees that perform clerical work were excluded from all calculations in accordance with Staff guidance.  Certain consultants and/or outsourced personnel that do not perform clerical work are included in the calculations. ------------------------------------------ In response to Item 5(E) – Compensation Arrangements, the Adviser has checked Commissions to refer to certain fee splitting and revenue sharing arrangements the Adviser maintains with third party custodians for some non-discretionary managed accounts. ------------------------------------------ In response to Schedule B – Indirect Owners, the Adviser has listed all required entities based on the percentage of voting shares owned. Specifically, BTG Pactual G7 Holding S.A. holds more than 75% of the total voting shares of BTG Pactual Holding S.A. In addition, BTG Pactual Holding Financeira Ltda. holds more than 75% of the voting shares of Banco BTG Pactual S.A.  ------------------------------------------ In response to Item 7.A of Schedule D, certain related persons have been omitted in accordance with SEC Staff guidance provided in the Frequently Asked Questions on Form ADV and IARD. A list of related persons who have been omitted is available upon request. The related persons not listed were omitted because they are wholly unrelated to the Adviser’s services and are not considered advisory affiliates.  The list of related persons not listed: (1) do not share the same physical location as the Adviser; (2) have no business dealings with the Adviser; (3) do not conduct shared operations with the Adviser; (4) do not refer clients or business to the Adviser; (5) do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser; and (6) do not share supervised persons or premises with the Adviser. The Adviser has no reason to believe that its relationship with the omitted related persons creates a conflict of interest with the Adviser's Advisory Clients. ------------------------------------------ In the Regulatory Action disclosure section, all disclosures over the past ten years have been included.  In addition, in an effort to be fully transparent and to be consistent with disclosures the BTG Pactual Group has made to its other international regulators, the following information is being voluntarily disclosed.  On July 9, 2014, the former controlling shareholder and former chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (“Banco BTG Pactual”), André Santos Esteves, reached an agreement with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance FDF (“FDF”) in connection with an inquiry by the FDF relating to the accidental omission of certain information in statements made to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”) by Mr. Esteves in 2011. Both Banco BTG Pactual and Mr. Esteves are listed as indirect owners of BTG Pactual Asset Management US, LLC. At the time such omissions were discovered in 2011, Mr. Esteves described to FINMA the rational for the omission and was advised that the matter would not result in any further inquiry or proceeding. The matter was revisited as a result of Banco BTG Pactual's opening of an unregulated commodities business in Switzerland in late 2013. In late 2013, Banco BTG Pactual visited FINMA to confirm its views that such business was not subject to FINMA oversight pursuant to applicable Swiss law and was advised that the matter from 2011 was being revisited. The inquiry centered on Mr. Esteves’ accidental failure to disclose an administrative investigation in Italy by the Italian Companies and Stock Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societá e La Borsa) that has previously been disclosed to the SEC in 2012. Mr. Esteves presented his explanations for such omission to the FDF, who determined to terminate its inquiry in exchange for a reparation payment to the Swiss Federation by Mr. Esteves in the amount of CHF 250,000. This matter did not result in any criminal liability whatsoever for Mr. Esteves and the payment is not classified as a fine under the laws of Switzerland. This matter does not rise to the level of a regulatory action and the reparation payment does not meet the definition of a “finding” or “administrative sanction” under the definitions outlined in the instructions of Form ADV.  Accordingly, no additional disclosures are being made under Item 11."

2000740,"SCHEDULE B: For federal income taxes purposes Davenport & Company LLC (the “LLC”) is organized as a limited liability company that is owned by five corporations that have elected to be taxed as S Corporations.  The multiple S Corporations are required due to tax law limitations on the number of permitted shareholders per each S Corporation.  Davenport's Schedule A lists the following five S corporations as direct owners: DAVENPORT & CO. OF VIRGINIA, INC; DAVENPORT CORP;  DAVA CORP; DAVENPORT IV, INC.; AND DAVENPORT FIVE, INC.  While this structure results in 5 direct owners of the membership units of the LLC; the only beneficial owners of the LLC are the shareholders of the S Corporations, all of whom are employees of the LLC.  For voting purposes, each individual shareholder of one of the S Corporation votes his or her shares on any matters with his or her S Corporation which in turn are relayed to the LLC without alteration.  Since the number of LLC membership units exactly equals the aggregate number of outstanding S Corporation shares, each vote by an S Corporation share is also an identical vote by a membership unit in the LLC.  Accordingly, it is our view that when calculating ownership percentages, we look to the ownership percentages of the beneficial owners of the S Corporations in the aggregate.  Thus, while an individual holding shares in a single S Corporation may own 10% of that S Corporation's shares, that same individual may have only 1% of the beneficial ownership of the membership units in the LLC. No individual employee indirectly holds more than 10% of membership interest of the firm.

Nebraska Revised Statute 8-1103 (2)(a) states “It shall be unlawful for any person to transact business in this state as an investment adviser or as an investment adviser representative unless he or she is registered under the act.” In an effort to comply with state law, UWC would register with the State of Nebraska.

It is also noted that as of 5/23/2025 to comply with Volcker Rule compliance, the FW Tessera LLC and FW Tessera Royale LLC private funds had a reduction in the Adviser's affiliated persons' ownership of the funds due to a charitable donation to a local charity, as approved by the Federal Reserve.

Likewise, the beneficial ownership in FW Tessera Royale LLC decreased from 81% on 12/31/2024 to 2.75% on 5/23/2025.  The private fund values will be updated when the next annul ADV filing is completed.  Although the Funds' applicable Advisory Agreements contain language suggesting discretionary authority, the Adviser’s ability to act is narrowly limited by the fund’s single-purpose mandate — investing only in a particular investment and under the provisions of the applicable agreements. Because there is no discretion in selecting among investments, we believe this falls outside the scope of discretionary management under Form ADV instructions. Reporting the RAUM as non-discretionary reflects the Adviser’s actual limited authority in practice."

Since the Funds are themselves clients, the firm counts these private fund assets when calculating RAUM. This has the practical effect of counting most of the private fund’s assets at the fund level and again at the separate account level of the investing client. The Funds do not pay a separate management fee to the Registrant, but do incur administrative costs of .08%.

The following affiliate is filing as a relying adviser as defined in the ABA Letter: BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, LLC. ------------------------------------------ In response to Items 5(A) and 5(B), the Adviser has included the number of employees as of the fiscal year end. Employees that perform clerical work were excluded from all calculations in accordance with Staff guidance.  Certain consultants and/or outsourced personnel that do not perform clerical work are included in the calculations. ------------------------------------------ In response to Item 5(E) – Compensation Arrangements, the Adviser has checked Commissions to refer to certain fee splitting and revenue sharing arrangements the Adviser maintains with third party custodians for some non-discretionary managed accounts. ------------------------------------------ In response to Schedule B – Indirect Owners, the Adviser has listed all required entities based on the percentage of voting shares owned. Specifically, BTG Pactual G7 Holding S.A. holds more than 75% of the total voting shares of BTG Pactual Holding S.A. In addition, BTG Pactual Holding Financeira Ltda. holds more than 75% of the voting shares of Banco BTG Pactual S.A.  ------------------------------------------ In response to Item 7.A of Schedule D, certain related persons have been omitted in accordance with SEC Staff guidance provided in the Frequently Asked Questions on Form ADV and IARD. A list of related persons who have been omitted is available upon request. The related persons not listed were omitted because they are wholly unrelated to the Adviser’s services and are not considered advisory affiliates.  The list of related persons not listed: (1) do not share the same physical location as the Adviser; (2) have no business dealings with the Adviser; (3) do not conduct shared operations with the Adviser; (4) do not refer clients or business to the Adviser; (5) do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser; and (6) do not share supervised persons or premises with the Adviser. The Adviser has no reason to believe that its relationship with the omitted related persons creates a conflict of interest with the Adviser's Advisory Clients. ------------------------------------------ In the Regulatory Action disclosure section, all disclosures over the past ten years have been included.  In addition, in an effort to be fully transparent and to be consistent with disclosures the BTG Pactual Group has made to its other international regulators, the following information is being voluntarily disclosed.  On July 9, 2014, the former controlling shareholder and former chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (“Banco BTG Pactual”), André Santos Esteves, reached an agreement with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance FDF (“FDF”) in connection with an inquiry by the FDF relating to the accidental omission of certain information in statements made to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”) by Mr. Esteves in 2011. Both Banco BTG Pactual and Mr. Esteves are listed as indirect owners of BTG Pactual Asset Management US, LLC. At the time such omissions were discovered in 2011, Mr. Esteves described to FINMA the rational for the omission and was advised that the matter would not result in any further inquiry or proceeding. The matter was revisited as a result of Banco BTG Pactual's opening of an unregulated commodities business in Switzerland in late 2013. In late 2013, Banco BTG Pactual visited FINMA to confirm its views that such business was not subject to FINMA oversight pursuant to applicable Swiss law and was advised that the matter from 2011 was being revisited. The inquiry centered on Mr. Esteves’ accidental failure to disclose an administrative investigation in Italy by the Italian Companies and Stock Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societá e La Borsa) that has previously been disclosed to the SEC in 2012. Mr. Esteves presented his explanations for such omission to the FDF, who determined to terminate its inquiry in exchange for a reparation payment to the Swiss Federation by Mr. Esteves in the amount of CHF 250,000. This matter did not result in any criminal liability whatsoever for Mr. Esteves and the payment is not classified as a fine under the laws of Switzerland. This matter does not rise to the level of a regulatory action and the reparation payment does not meet the definition of a “finding” or “administrative sanction” under the definitions outlined in the instructions of Form ADV.  Accordingly, no additional disclosures are being made under Item 11."

1997814,"Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (""AMG""), a publicly traded asset management company, holds an equity interest in River Road Asset Management, LLC (“River Road”) through its holding company RRAM Acquisition, LLC (“RRAM Acquisition”). AMG’s equity interest in River Road is structured so that River Road maintains operational autonomy in managing its business. The relationship between AMG, RRAM Acquisition and River Road is defined by an operating agreement that provides that neither AMG nor RRAM Acquisition has the authority or the ability to operate or manage River Road’s business in the normal course. Accordingly, AMG and RRAM Acquisition are not “control persons” of River Road. AMG also holds equity interests in certain other investment advisers (""AMG Affiliates""). Each of the AMG Affiliates, including River Road, operates autonomously and independently of AMG and of each other. Except as described in this Form ADV, River Road does not have any business dealings with these AMG Affiliates and does not conduct any joint operations with them. River Road carries out its asset management activity, including the exercise of investment discretion and voting rights, independent of the AMG Affiliates. The AMG Affiliates do not formulate advice for River Road’s clients and do not, in River Road’s view, present any potential conflict of interest with River Road’s clients. Consequently, individual information on each AMG Affiliate is not listed in Section 7.A. of Schedule D of Part 1A of Form ADV, unless River Road has business dealings with certain AMG Affiliates. A list of all AMG Affiliates is available to River Road’s clients upon request. River Road has mutual fund subadvisory agreements with AMG Funds LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG, under which River Road serves as subadviser to multiple mutual funds in the AMG Funds family of mutual funds, which are sponsored and advised by AMG Funds LLC. As described in each fund’s prospectus, the fund pays AMG Funds LLC an advisory fee, and AMG Funds LLC pays River Road a subadvisory fee with respect to the fund. The fees payable to River Road may be reduced by the amount of certain shareholder servicing fees, distribution related expenses, and other expenses paid by AMG Funds LLC on behalf of the funds, under an agreement by which River Road has agreed to reimburse AMG Funds LLC for a certain portion of these fees. In addition, one River Road employee is a registered representative of AMG Distributors, Inc., a limited purpose broker-dealer that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG Funds LLC and that is the underwriter of the AMG Funds family of funds and placement agent for certain affiliate private funds. River Road has marketing agreements with AMG Funds LLC under which AMG Funds LLC markets River Road's investment management services to unaffiliated third party intermediaries that sponsor subadvised mutual funds and/or other platforms such as defined contribution retirement plan platforms and to institutional clients.  River Road pays AMG Funds LLC a success fee for these services. River Road has a client service/marketing agreement with non-U.S. subsidiaries of AMG under which the non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries introduce River Road's investment management services to prospective institutional clients and/or provide institutional client services to certain of River Road's clients in various foreign jurisdictions. River Road pays the non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries a success fee for these services. The non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries are not broker-dealers, investment advisers, or any of the other financial institutions described in Item 7.A. of Form ADV Part 1A. Depending on the foreign jurisdiction, the non-U.S. AMG subsidiaries may be registered or exempt from registration, as appropriate, with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authorities."

1989144,"AWH Financial, LLC (“AWH”) solely solicits prospective clients for third-party investment advisers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  AWH does not provide to other persons for compensation any advice about the value of securities or whether to purchase or sell securities.  Nonetheless, based on SEC and Staff guidance, AWH meets the definition of “investment adviser” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”) because in recommending third-party investment advisers it is considered to be “advising others” within the meaning of Section 202(a)(11) of the Advisers Act.  In addition, due to variations in the definition of “investment adviser” in state securities laws and regulations, AWH is subject to registration as an investment adviser in at least 15 states and therefore is eligible to register with the SEC pursuant to Rule 203A-2(d) under the Advisers Act.  The number of clients set forth in Item 5.C(1) is as of December 31, 2024 and represents clients of AWH that have not yet been onboarded by another registered investment adviser (""RIA"") for which AWH solicits clients.

For the third-party SLOAs, the Firm maintains records and relies upon the guidance set forth in the SEC No-Action Letter of February 21, 2019 to avoid the need for a surprise annual audit of these third-party SLOA assets which would otherwise be required of an adviser with custody.  The transfer by Bryan Hancock of his interest in Timberchase Financial, LLC to his revocable trust (Timberchase Trust) does not constitute a change in control as the trust is under Mr. Hancock’s control; therefore, pursuant to the SEC’s IM Guidance No. 2016­-05 of November 2016 (pp. 4­, § 3), no succession occurred, and, pursuant to that guidance, the firm has updated Schedule A accordingly."

1999993,"In response to Section 7.B.(1), Lowe, Brockenbrough & Company, Inc. (“Brockenbrough”) has provided information for each of the private funds for which it is engaged as the investment advisor. Bespoke Capital Strategies, LP (“BCS”) is a Delaware series limited partnership with seven distinct series in which a limited partner can invest. Six of the seven series are components in mini-master feeder structures, wherein the tax-exempt series serve as feeder funds to the corresponding master taxable series. Please note that because of their role as a master series in this mini-master feeder structure, the assets of taxable series do include the tax-exempt investment as well. Each of the seven series are displayed in Section 7.B.(1) as separate private funds as they each have and maintain separate books and records. Bespoke Private Strategies, LP (“BPS”) is a Delaware series limited partnership with twenty-eight distinct series to which a limited partner can commit capital. These are closed-end structures organized by vintage year that accept, or previously accepted, capital commitments for a designated period of time, before closing to new investors. Each of the twenty-eight aforementioned series are considered feeder funds and are aggregated into one or more master series through which all investments are made. For example, the Bespoke Private Strategies, LP – Series Taxable 2014 and Bespoke Private Strategies, LP – Series Tax-Exempt 2014 are feeder funds for the Bespoke Private Strategies, LP – Series Master 2014. Each of the feeder funds and master funds are listed as separate private funds in Section 7.B.(1). The format of the ADV does not allow for more than one master series to be attributed to a feeder fund. Please note the following series have more than one master series: Series Taxable 2015 (Series Master 2015 and Real Estate Series Master 2015), Series Tax-Exempt 2015 (Series Master 2015 and Real Estate Series Master 2015), Series Taxable 2016 (Series Master 2016 and Real Estate Series Master 2016), Series Tax-Exempt 2016 (Series Master 2016 and Real Estate Series Master 2016), Series Taxable 2019 (Series Master 2019 and Real Estate Series Master 2019), Series Tax-Exempt 2019 (Series Master 2019 and Real Estate Series Master 2019), Series Taxable 2020 (Series Master 2020 and Real Assets Series Master 2020), and Series Tax-Exempt 2020 (Series Master 2020 and Real Assets Series Master 2020), Series Taxable 2022 (Series Master 2022 and Real Asset Series Master 2022), and Series Tax-Exempt 2022 (Series Master 2022 and Real Asset Series Master 2022).   Regulatory Assets Under Management: For purposes of Items 5.D and 5.F, Brockenbrough has separately managed account relationships with certain clients where the client has invested in pooled investment vehicles managed by Brockenbrough. The firm has reported these assets in Item 5.D and 5.F as regulatory assets under management with respect to its relationships as a separately managed account adviser and pooled investment vehicle adviser. This results in redundant accounting of certain assets in the calculation of regulatory assets under management, but provides accurate information about how Brockenbrough manages separately managed accounts in Section 5.K. of Schedule D. Additionally, the assets of the affiliated private funds include $301,977,690 of unfunded commitments. Certain client relationships for whom we have a discretionary investment management agreement have been deemed to be non-discretionary for purposes of calculating regulatory assets under management. In these cases, clients include those for whom we provide recommendations and facilitate the execution of investments on the client’s behalf. Using margin or borrowing is not a part of our investment strategy with respect to separately managed account clients. Certain clients do utilize borrowing or margin. Consistent with the way Brockenbrough reports to these clients, regulatory assets under management reflect the balances net of any margin or borrowing balances."

Section 5.K.(1) Asset Categories Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC. used the following methodology to determine how to categorize assets that could be classified in more than one category: 1.            Common stock, preferred securities, structured products and units are included in the Exchange-Traded Equity Securities category if the security traded on a national exchange and within the Non Exchange-Traded Equity Securities category if they do not traded on a national exchange.  2.            Investment Grade Corporate Bonds include corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of BBB or higher and a Moody’s rating of Baa or higher. Corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations and real estate mortgage investment conduits that have an S&P rating of below BBB or a Moody’s rating below Baa are categorized as Non-Investment Grade Corporate Bonds.  Those securities given opposing ratings by Moody’s and S&P (investment-grade and non-investment grade) automatically default to the non-investment grade category.  3.            Annuities have characteristics that are not primarily representative of any of the defined asset categories, therefore annuity products are listed in the Other category.   4.

In addition, in our January 19, 2024, Annual Amendment Filing, we revised our response to Item 3.C. from California to Delaware. This change was made effective in correction of prior responses to this item. Wright Fund Management, LLC, now Ocean Park Asset Management, LLC, was organized in the State of Delaware on October 17, 2007, and has continually remained a Delaware organized company since its initial filing with the State of Delaware. None of these changes results in the creation of a new legal entity, a change in the state or territory in which our business is organized, change of control or ownership, a reorganization of our business, or a change in our form of organization.

On October 1, 2024, Ocean Park Asset Management, LLC and its affiliate, Ocean Park Asset Management, Inc., consolidated its operations and advisory services under the single registered entity of Ocean Park Asset Management, LLC. Prior to the consolidation, Ocean Park Asset Management, Inc. was a corporation organized in August 1989 under the laws of the State of California that was registered with the SEC as an investment advisor from December 1989 to December 2024. Kenneth L. Sleeper and David C. Wright were the founders, principals, and controlling owners of Ocean Park Asset Management, Inc.   In relation to Ocean Park’s response to Item 9, Custody, Ocean Park discloses custody here only in that Ocean Park has been granted the ability to disburse funds to one or more third parties as specifically designated by clients through Standing Letters of Authorization. All such accounts are custodied at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. Ocean Park does not obtain an annual surprise examination pursuant to the exemptive conditions within the SEC No Action Letter issued February 21, 2017 to the Investment Adviser Association.   Where Ocean Park provides information regarding Regulatory Assets Under Management (""RegAUM"") and/or other asset figures in this filing, such RegAUM is as of December 31, 2024. Because Ocean Park includes affiliated funds in its discretionary managed accounts (as noted in response to item 8.A.(3)), and where such funds include the Ocean Park Mutual Funds and Ocean Park ETFs, Ocean Park has excluded from its RegAUM, under Item 5.D.(3) and Item 5.F.(2), that portion which is invested in in its affiliated funds so as not to ""double-count"" RegAUM. RegAUM and Assets reported under Item 5.I, Item 5.K.(3), and Item 9.A.(2) do not exclude affiliated fund investments to give a distinct report of total assets associated with those particular Items.

1995464,"The Adviser is compensated by its affiliate, Eastspring Investment (Singapore) Limited (“Eastspring Singapore”), for providing advisory and other services to third party clients.  The Adviser’s primary activity is to provide certain marketing, sales servicing, and client support in the US on behalf of Eastspring Singapore.  Eastspring Singapore is an affiliated investment management entity that is domiciled and registered under, among other regulatory bodies, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).  Eastspring Singapore is also registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as a registered investment adviser.    Both the Adviser and Eastspring Singapore are affiliates of Prudential plc, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom (""UK Parent""), which is publicly held.  Like Eastspring Singapore, the Adviser is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of the UK Parent.  The UK Parent and its affiliated companies constitute one of the world's leading financial services groups.  It provides insurance and financial services through its subsidiaries and affiliates throughout the world.  The UK Parent is not affiliated in any manner with Prudential Financial, Inc., a company whose principal place of business is in the United States of America.     In the US, the Adviser seeks to identify and introduce to Eastspring Singapore potential institutional client prospects.  Such prospects, once introduced, would contract directly with Eastspring Singapore for any investment management or advisory services.  In marketing Eastspring Singapore’s services, the Adviser’s employees also may make general recommendations about securities or a type of security which may be viewed to constitute investment advice.  For example, the Adviser's employees may recommend an asset allocation that favors investments in Asian securities or discuss certain current holdings in client portfolios with institutional client prospects.  In these circumstances, the Adviser’s clients would be the prospects.  Eastspring Singapore, and not a prospect, compensates the Adviser for its marketing and any advisory services provided in that context by the Adviser.  Eastspring US has been engaged to provide introductory services for Eastspring Singapore strategies. Eastspring US is not currently a client of Eastspring Singapore. Eastspring US does not charge a separate fee for its introductory services, however it will receive compensation for these services should one become an investor in Eastspring Singapore strategies, based on the fee split of the management fee revenue. No other material conflicts of interest arise in providing this endorsement other than any compensation is an incentive for Eastspring US to make this introduction and market affiliate specific strategies.  In regards to Item 7.A, we have pursuant to the Form Instructions, omitted certain related persons from disclosure in Item 7.A., and will provide a supplemental list of such related persons upon request.

2000253,"In reference to Item 5.E.  Typical subscription fees range up to $62,000 per quarter and are negotiated separately with each client, taking into account the nature of the service level required by each client (in particular the number of service users at a particular client and the level of engagement time required from our analysts). The fee is payable with hard dollars by most end-user clients. However, some client payments are made through a commission sharing agreement (CSA) through a client’s intermediary.  The consulting fee is usually either a fixed hourly amount for a fixed period of time or a variable amount for perceived contribution to client investment process and/or interactions determined by an internal voting process conducted by the client, which The Analyst does not have control over. If The Analyst decides to produce bespoke research requested by a client, The Analyst and the client will negotiate a one-off fee for the creation of the research materials (e.g., a fundamental review of the business and model). In this case, the fee will be based upon the expected scope and time commitment of the project. The negotiated fee will be collected in arrears or in advance, as agreed with each individual client. The Analyst also has clients who use a voluntary idea-generation ranking system (alpha-capture systems) to which The Analyst submits ideas. These clients may pay compensation at their discretion if the submitted ideas perform well, as compared to the performance of other providers contributing to their platform, market conditions, their own performance, and other factors. Limited Negotiability of Advisory Fees: Although The Analyst has established the aforementioned fee range, we retain the discretion to negotiate alternative fees on a client-by-client basis. Client facts, circumstances and needs are considered in determining the fee schedule. The specific annual fee is identified in the contract between The Analyst and each client. We may group certain related client accounts for the purposes of achieving the minimum fee and determining the annualized fee.  GENERAL INFORMATION  Termination of the Advisory Relationship:  While termination criteria vary depending on the specific terms of each advisory agreement, typically, either the client or The Analyst may terminate the advisory relationship by giving written notice to the other party not less than 10 business days prior to any Optional Termination Date, as defined in the advisory agreement, or 1 calendar month prior to any Optional Termination Date.   ""Optional Termination Date"" means those dates (if any) during the Subscription Period ahead of which the parties may serve notice to terminate these Terms, as specified in the Engagement Letter and Terms of Business.     If the client is within an Introductory Period, then the advisory relationship would terminate at this time; outside of the Introductory Period, the relationship may terminate up to 3 months later.  Mutual Fund and Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) Fees: All fees paid to The Analyst for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the fees and expenses charged by mutual funds and/or ETFs to their shareholders. These fees and expenses are described in each fund’s prospectus. These fees will generally include a management fee, other fund expenses, and a possible distribution fee. If the fund also imposes sales charges, their client may pay an initial or deferred sales charge. Additional Fees and Expenses: In addition to our advisory fees, our clients are also responsible for fees and expenses charged by custodians and imposed by broker dealers, including, but not limited to, any transaction charges or commissions imposed by a broker dealer with which an independent investment manager effects transactions for the client's account(s). Please refer to the ""Brokerage Practices"" section (Item 12) of this Form ADV for additional information. Advisory Fees in General: Clients should note that similar advisory services may be available from other registered (or unregistered) investment advisers for similar or lower fees.

SagePoint is not otherwise affiliated with our firm. Clients can enter into a separate commission-based arrangement with such individuals (but not with AmeriFlex® directly) and SagePoint for securities brokerage services (a “Brokerage Arrangement”). Investments made through the Brokerage Relationship may be separate from the advisory services we provide to you, and therefore, AmeriFlex® does not have a fiduciary duty over such Brokerage Relationship recommendations.   Under the foregoing arrangement, these Dually Registered Persons, acting in their capacity as registered representatives of SagePoint, may receive commissions, ongoing distribution fees (i.e., trails), and other compensation based on sales of securities to clients. This creates a conflict of interest insofar as such Dually Registered Persons may have a financial incentive to sell securities to clients for which they may collect commissions. Alternatively, they may have an incentive to forego providing you with advisory services when appropriate, and instead recommend the purchase of commissionable investments, if they deem that the payout for recommending the purchase of these investments would be higher than providing management advice on these products for an advisory fee. Clients are advised that fees paid to AmeriFlex® for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the commissions and/or other forms of compensation that may be earned by any Dually Registered Persons for selling securities products to clients through SagePoint.

Clients may use any broker-dealer they choose for purchase of these products and services. We encourage you to ask us about the conflicts of interest presented by the dual registration of our IARs.  Certain of our Advisory Affiliates are licensed insurance agencies and/or some of our IARs are independently licensed on an individual basis to sell insurance in one or more states acting as direct agent representatives of a specific insurance company or companies. Insurance related business is transacted with advisory clients and licensed individuals may receive commissions from insurance products sold to clients.

In the event a third-party consultant or finder referred an investor for a private fund and is being compensated, PPM will inform the investor that the private fund or PPM, as the case may be, is paying such compensation, and provide other information as required by law.  Solicitation or referral arrangements with third parties to obtain referrals for prospective clients are made in accordance with Rule 206(4)-1 under the Advisers Act (the “Marketing Rule”).

The client has the ability to terminate or change the instruction to the clients qualified custodian. 5.

In each case, when we commence reporting of performance to investors, we will report an aggregate return to investors based on the consolidated performance of both Master Funds. We believe this approach better reflects how investors view the investment (i.e., as an investment into one fund based on one capital commitment rather than an investment into multiple funds).  GoldenTree has six affiliated, U.S.-based relying advisers, GoldenTree Loan Management, LP (""GLM Master"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM, LP (""GLM Sub"" and together with ""GLM Master"", collectively “GLM”), GoldenTree Loan Management II LP (""GLM Master II"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM II, LP (""GLM Sub II"" and together with ""GLM Master II"", collectively “GLM II”) and GoldenTree Loan Management III LP (""GLM Master III"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM III, LP (""GLM Sub III"" and together with ""GLM Master III"", collectively “GLM III”).

PwC informed the Adviser that a member firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited performed a non-audit service for a portfolio company that the BlackRock Relevant funds acquired a controlling interest in Environmental 360 Solutions Inc. (“E360”). From February 16, 2023, the date the Blackrock Relevant Funds acquired E360, through March 17, 2023, such member firm was engaged to act as the sole arbitrator during a proceeding between E360 and an unrelated third-party defendant, which is inconsistent with the auditor independence rules pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(4)(x) of Regulation S-X. The total fee associated with the service was approximately $40,000, all of which was incurred prior to the acquisition.  PwC communicated the facts and circumstances surrounding this service to the Adviser, including the scope and duration of this service and the associated fees incurred by PwC. PwC also noted the identified service did not have any direct accounting impact on the financial results of the BlackRock Relevant funds. The Adviser and PwC have separately considered the impact that the service may have had on PwC’s objectivity and impartiality with respect to PwC’s audit of the BlackRock Relevant funds. After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, PwC concluded that (i) PwC is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection with their audits of the BlackRock Relevant funds’ financial statements as of and for the year ending December 31, 2023, and (ii) a reasonable investor, knowing all the relevant facts and circumstances, would reach the same conclusion.

Item 5 & Part 2: For purposes of answering Items 5.D, 5.F, and 5.G, we have included the assets and services provided to all (US and foreign) clients that contract directly with the registrant.  Section 7.A- We have not completed Section 7.A of Schedule D for certain related parties because we do not have: 1) business dealings with these related persons in connection with advisory services that we provide to our clients; 2) we do not conduct shared operations with these related persons; 3) we do not refer prospective clients or business to these related persons and these related persons do not refer prospective clients or business to us; 4) we do not share supervised persons or premises with these related persons; and 5) we have no reason to believe that our relationship with these related persons otherwise creates a conflict of interest with our clients.  ""ITEM 11 - We have answered the questions in Part 1A Item 11 with respect to our employees (other than employees performing only clerical, administrative, support or similar functions) and officers, partners and directors employed by Candriam (“Candriam EOPDs”) to the best of our knowledge and subject to compliance with the Luxembourg law of August 2, 2002 on the protection of persons with regard to the processing of personal data, as amended. This law prohibits Candriam from asking Candriam EOPDs to respond to the majority of questions in Item 11. Even for those questions where Candriam may ask its Candriam EOPDs for their responses, the law prohibits the disclosure of information that otherwise would be provided in the relevant Disclosure Reporting Page of this Form without further safeguards in place for the transfer of personal data."" Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1): The private funds are registered in several jurisdictions. We have listed the primary jurisdictions of regulation only in response to question 5. With respect to question 12 for the funds, there is no minimum investment commitment for the funds in which we answered ""$1,"" therefore the amount invested by investors are under their discretion and can vary significantly between investors. The figures reported in response to question 13 for the private funds are based on information available to Candriam, considering that it has a detailed view on the clients and distributors to which it sells fund interests directly, but has no information on the number of beneficial owners to whom its third party distributors sell its funds in certain non-US markets. Therefore, this approximate number of beneficial owners refers to the number of end investors and non-US distributors invested in the fund with which Candriam has a direct relationship. The figures reported in response to question 15 for the private funds take into account the percentage of the fund owned by Candriam managed funds of funds. Due to the manner in which underlying Candriam funds are distributed and held in markets outside the United States where their shares are sold, however, Candriam is not currently able to provide specific information regarding the percentage of third-party fund of funds that may invest in a given Candriam fund. For the purposes of responding to question 20, Candriam has calculated the figures as a percentage of total clients. Candriam has responded ""no"" to question 28, except for one fund. Except for this one fund, Candriam does not use any third parties to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. However, Candriam enlists several regulated distributors for the purpose of selling the funds in non-US markets in accordance with the requirements of applicable (non-US) regulations. Candriam does not use a website to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. It understands that distributors located outside the United States are expected to target their marketing efforts exclusively to non-US investors in their home markets. Non US distributors may use websites targeted to investors in non-US jurisdictions for the purpose of distributing shares of Candriam funds.  Form ADV-NR: Candriam is neither a partnership nor an unincorporated business association and thus does not consider itself to be required to File Form ADV-NR in connection with its registration. Candriam has however signed the non-resident adviser execution page, and, as disclosed in Schedule B, it is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a company organized and operating in the United States. With regard to the information listed in Schedule B, please note that New York Life Insurance Company is a mutual life insurance company and does not have shareholders.
