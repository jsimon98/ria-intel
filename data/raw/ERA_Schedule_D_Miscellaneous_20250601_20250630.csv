1988527,"HSBC Asset Management India Private Limited (“AMIN”) manages non-U.S. open end funds that are registered in India and whose shares are only offered and sold outside of the United States (the “Non-U.S. Registered Funds”). AMIN has fully acquired a local Indian asset management company, which had previously managed a number of these Non-U.S. Registered Funds, and at the time of acquisition one or more non-U.S. investors that relocated to, or established a mailing address in, the United States were investors in these Non-U.S. Registered Funds. Other non-U.S. investors may relocate to, or establish a mailing address in, the United States without the prior knowledge of AMIN. These Non-U.S. Registered Funds, which are identified in Section 7.B.(1), are not directly offered or sold to U.S. persons (as defined under Regulation S) or within the territories of the United States, and AMIN does not otherwise do any business in the United States. AMIN is a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of HSBC Holdings Plc. As such, it has numerous related persons that are financial institutions or have financial industry affiliations (including other investment advisers). For purposes of this filing, AMIN has included in Item 7.A and Section 7.A only those related persons with whom AMIN has a relationship with respect to the Non-U.S. Registered Funds that are identified in Section 7.B.(1). A complete list of AMIN’s related persons can be provided upon request. With respect to Question 10 in Section 7.B.(1), the Non-U.S. Registered Funds have been characterized as “other” private funds (namely, Indian registered open end funds) because they are registered in India and have open end fund structures. With respect to Question 26 in Section 7.B.(1), although AMIN provides a number of administrative services (including back-office services), the Non-U.S. Registered Funds have engaged Computer Age Management Services Ltd., located in Chennai, India, as transfer agent/registrar and Citibank, N.A., located in Mumbai, India, as custodian/fund accountant. Neither Computer Age Management Services Ltd. nor Citibank, N.A. has been listed as an “administrator” to the Non-U.S. Registered Funds in Question 26. With respect to Question 28 in Section 7.B.(1), consistent with local practices in India, investors can purchase shares of the Non-U.S. Registered Funds through a large network of individuals and institutions. However, because shares of the Non-U.S. Registered Funds are only offered and sold outside of the United States, these individuals and institutions, which could be considered “marketers,” have been omitted."

Further, as an ERA, the Registrant is not subject to Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act, and it is not currently subject to a state law equivalent, which would require fund investors to be qualified clients.

Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1)A, Item 23: With respect to certain private funds that have been audited by Deloitte, the financial statements are prepared under IFRS.  Regarding the private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7B1: ICG Senior Debt Partners I and ICG Senior Debt Partners II are structured as an “umbrella fund” as opposed to a “master-feeder fund”. In an umbrella fund structure, the law of the fund’s local jurisdiction permits the creation of multiple compartments with each compartment linked to a specific portfolio of investments which is segregated from the portfolio of investments of the other compartments. Similarly, each compartment is linked to a group of investors who are separate and distinct from the investors of the other compartments.  Pursuant to this ring-fencing principle, although the umbrella fund constitutes one single legal entity, the assets of a compartment are exclusively available only to satisfy the rights of investors in relation to that compartment and the rights of creditors whose claims have arisen in connection with the operation of that compartment.  Our response in Section 7.B. for the ICG Private Markets Fund SCSP SICAV-RAIF fund is the aggregate value of the four compartments that form  ICG Private Markets Fund SCSP SICAV-RAIF.
