In addition, except as set forth in our responses to Item 11, our responses to Item 11 do not include information regarding the disciplinary history of Lloyds Bank plc and its advisory affiliates in connection with matters not relating to our investment advisory business. In the ordinary course of business, on an annual basis, Lloyds Bank plc and its advisory affiliates are subject to threatened and actual legal and regulatory challenges, investigations and enforcement actions related to our other businesses. For example, Lloyds Bank plc and its advisory affiliates are regularly the subject of customer lawsuits relating to the banking services of Lloyds Bank plc (such as in relation to Motor Finance Commission and Payment Protection Insurance) that may involve allegations of violations of various bank regulatory requirements. Inclusion of such actions related to the non-advisory businesses of Lloyds Bank plc and our advisory affiliates would have resulted in additional affirmative responses to the questions in Item 11."

The remaining membership interests in HSIM are held by certain senior employees of the Manager.  The Manager is governed by a board of directors (the “Manager Board”). The members of the Manager Board are appointed pursuant to a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”) among the Manager, HSIM, and the limited partners of IPG Cayman LP, a private fund formed in the Cayman Islands as an exempted limited partnership and managed by the Manager (the “Flagship Fund”). Under the Voting Agreement, neither HSIM nor any limited partner of the Flagship Fund (including IPG USA SCO, as defined and further described below) has the right to designate a majority of the members of the Manager Board. Therefore, no one person has the right, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the Manager. IPG USA SCO LP (“IPG USA SCO”), which is the majority limited partner in the Flagship Fund, is a private fund formed as a Scottish limited partnership, which is sponsored and controlled by IP Group plc, a United Kingdom public limited company that is listed on the London Stock Exchange (“PLC”). As an entity controlled by PLC, IPG USA SCO forms part of PLC’s group accounts for purposes of the annual audit performed by PLC’s independent public accountant firm. In addition to managing the Flagship Fund, the Manager also subadvises a portion of IPG USA SCO’s portfolio directly pursuant to a co-investment and management agreement. The gross asset value listed herein for IPG USA SCO represents the portion of its portfolio subadvised by the Manager pursuant to such co-investment and management agreement, and the administrator listed herein for IPG USA SCO performs certain accounting and administrative services with respect to such subadvised portion of its portfolio. The employees of the Manager who own HSIM collectively beneficially own less than 0.5% of the Flagship Fund, and as such, the response to question 14 of Private Fund Reporting for the Flagship Fund is rounded down to 0%. IPG USA (GP) LLC, a Cayman Islands limited liability company (the “General Partner”), serves as general partner of the Flagship Fund. The General Partner is owned by the Manager and an affiliate.

A list of related persons who have been omitted is available upon request. The related persons not listed were omitted because they are wholly unrelated to the Adviser’s services and are not considered advisory affiliates. The list of related persons not listed: (1) do not share the same physical location as the Adviser; (2) have no business dealings with the Adviser; (3) do not conduct shared operations with the Adviser; (4) do not refer clients or business to the Adviser; (5) do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser; and (6) do not share supervised persons or premises with the Adviser. The Adviser has no reason to believe that its relationship with the omitted related persons creates a conflict of interest with the Adviser's Advisory Clients. ------------------------------------------ In the Regulatory Action disclosure section, all disclosures over the past ten years have been included. In addition, in an effort to be fully transparent and to be consistent with disclosures the BTG Pactual Group has made to its other international regulators, the following information is being voluntarily disclosed. On July 9, 2014, the former controlling shareholder and former chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (“Banco BTG Pactual”), André Santos Esteves, reached an agreement with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance FDF (“FDF”) in connection with an inquiry by the FDF relating to the accidental omission of certain information in statements made to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”) by Mr. Esteves in 2011. Both Banco BTG Pactual and Mr. Esteves are listed as indirect owners of BTG Pactual Global Asset Management Ltd. At the time such omissions were discovered in 2011, Mr. Esteves described to FINMA the rational for the omission and was advised that the matter would not result in any further inquiry or proceeding. The matter was revisited as a result of Banco BTG Pactual's opening of an unregulated commodities business in Switzerland in late 2013. In late 2013, Banco BTG Pactual visited FINMA to confirm its views that such business was not subject to FINMA oversight pursuant to applicable Swiss law and was advised that the matter from 2011 was being revisited. The inquiry centered on Mr. Esteves’ accidental failure to disclose an administrative investigation in Italy by the Italian Companies and Stock Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societá e La Borsa) that has previously been disclosed to the SEC in 2012. Mr. Esteves presented his explanations for such omission to the FDF, who determined to terminate its inquiry in exchange for a reparation payment to the Swiss Federation by Mr. Esteves in the amount of CHF 250,000. This matter did not result in any criminal liability whatsoever for Mr. Esteves and the payment is not classified as a fine under the laws of Switzerland. This matter does not rise to the level of a regulatory action and the reparation payment does not meet the definition of a “finding” or “administrative sanction” under the definitions outlined in the instructions of Form ADV. Accordingly, no additional disclosures are being made under Item 11."

BTG Pactual (UK) Limited is required to abide by the Deed Poll and Declaration in relation to the past business of 'BTG Pactual Europe LLP' for which the firm has accepted responsibility as regulated activities and investment business carried on by the firm.   ------------------------------------------  The Adviser has supplied all Advisory Client related data herein as of 12/31/2024.  ------------------------------------------ In response to Schedule B – Indirect Owners, the Adviser has listed all required entities based on the percentage of voting shares owned.   Specifically, BTG Pactual G7 Holding S.A. holds more than 50% of the total voting shares of BTG Pactual Holding S.A. In addition, BTG Pactual Holding Financeira Ltda. holds more than 75% of the voting shares of Banco BTG Pactual S.A.  ------------------------------------------ In response to Item 7.A of Schedule D, certain related persons have been omitted in accordance with SEC Staff guidance provided in the Frequently Asked Questions on Form ADV and IARD. A list of related persons who have been omitted is available upon request. The related persons not listed were omitted because they are wholly unrelated to the Adviser’s services and are not considered advisory affiliates.  The list of related persons: (1) do not share the same physical location as the Adviser; (2) have no business dealings with the Adviser; (3) do not conduct shared operations with the Adviser; (4) do not refer clients or business to the Adviser; (5) do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser; and (6) do not share supervised persons or premises with the Adviser. The Adviser has no reason to believe that its relationship with the omitted related persons creates a conflict of interest with the Adviser's Advisory Clients. ------------------------------------------ In the Regulatory Action disclosure section, all disclosures over the past ten years have been included.  In addition, in an effort to be fully transparent and to be consistent with disclosures the BTG Pactual Group has made to its other international regulators, the following information is being voluntarily disclosed.    On July 9, 2014, the former controlling shareholder and former chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (“Banco BTG Pactual”), André Santos Esteves, reached an agreement with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance FDF (“FDF”) in connection with an inquiry by the FDF relating to the accidental omission of certain information in statements made to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”) by Mr. Esteves in 2011. Both Banco BTG Pactual and Mr. Esteves are listed as indirect owners of BTG Pactual Asset Management US, LLC. At the time such omissions were discovered in 2011, Mr. Esteves described to FINMA the rational for the omission and was advised that the matter would not result in any further inquiry or proceeding. The matter was revisited as a result of Banco BTG Pactual's opening of an unregulated commodities business in Switzerland in late 2013. In late 2013, Banco BTG Pactual visited FINMA to confirm its views that such business was not subject to FINMA oversight pursuant to applicable Swiss law and was advised that the matter from 2011 was being revisited. The inquiry centered on Mr. Esteves’ accidental failure to disclose an administrative investigation in Italy by the Italian Companies and Stock Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societá e La Borsa) that has previously been disclosed to the SEC in 2012. Mr. Esteves presented his explanations for such omission to the FDF, who determined to terminate its inquiry in exchange for a reparation payment to the Swiss Federation by Mr. Esteves in the amount of CHF 250,000. This matter did not result in any criminal liability whatsoever for Mr. Esteves and the payment is not classified as a fine under the laws of Switzerland. This matter does not rise to the level of a regulatory action and the reparation payment does not meet the definition of a “finding” or “administrative sanction” under the definitions outlined in the instructions of Form ADV.  Accordingly, no additional disclosures are being made under Item 11."

Regarding Schedule D, Section 7.A. for NW GP II, LLC and NW GP III, LLC (each, a “GP Entity”), the Registrant notes that each GP Entity is the general partner to Registrant’s private fund clients. Each GP Entity is not filing its own Form ADV but is instead relying on the interpretive guidance outlined in the “Frequently Asked Questions on Form ADV and IARD” on the SEC’s website under the heading “Reporting to the SEC as an Exempt Reporting Adviser.” That guidance essentially permits a GP entity to a private fund to rely on the Form ADV of the fund’s investment adviser. In addition, as an ERA, the Registrant is not subject to Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act, and it is not currently subject to a state law equivalent, which would require fund investors to be qualified clients. As a result, Registrant has marked “no” in response to question 15(b) of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1).

As a result, Registrant has marked “no” in response to question 15(b) of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1)."

OF SCHEDULE D FOR PARTIES THAT SERVE AS SPONSOR, GENERAL PARTNER, MANAGING MEMBER (OR EQUIVALENT) OF POOLED INVESTMENT VEHICLES MANAGED BY CATTERTON MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC OR L CATTERTON EUROPE SAS. INFORMATION ABOUT THOSE ENTITIES IS INCLUDED IN FORM ADV’S OTHERWISE FILED FOR CATTERTON MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC AND L CATTERTON EUROPE SAS.  SCHEDULE D ITEM 7(B)(1). Pursuant to authority under the organizational documents for each of the funds, alternative investment vehicles (“AIVs”) have been created as structuring vehicles for particular investments made by certain of the funds to address various tax, regulatory or other similar concerns. Where an AIV has been created, limited partners in the particular fund have not made a new investment decision to invest through the AIV because each of the AIVs is structured to (i) have the ability to call capital up to the then remaining capital commitments of the applicable fund entity and (ii) have the same pool of investors investing through the applicable fund entity. For these reasons, AIVs have not been separately reported on Form ADV but rather aggregated with the applicable fund for ADV reporting purposes only (e.g. adding together the applicable fund and related AIV for purposes of, among other things, reporting gross assets of, and number of investors in, the fund). We believe this aggregation alleviates confusion relating to the fund family capital commitments and number of investors.  SCHEDULE B.

We've done this for several reasons: 1) We would be required to amend the master Form D every time we added a new nested series LLC.  2) Each of the series has filed a unique Form D with the SEC. Filing another for the master fund would duplicate the notice to the SEC. We are happy to provide a full list of the series LLC Form D file numbers if necessary. 3) We have paid state securities agencies in full for every dollar advised by Wefunder Advisors LLC.
