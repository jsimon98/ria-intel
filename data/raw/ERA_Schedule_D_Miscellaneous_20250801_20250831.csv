2010625,"In response to Schedule B ? Indirect Owners, the Adviser has listed all required entities based on the percentage of voting shares owned. Specifically, BTG Pactual G7 Holding S.A. holds more than 75% of the total voting shares of BTG Pactual Holding S.A. In addition, BTG Pactual Holding Financeira Ltda. holds more than 75% of the voting shares of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. ------------------------------------------ In response to Item 7.A of Schedule D, certain related persons have been omitted in accordance with SEC Staff guidance provided in the Frequently Asked Questions on Form ADV and IARD. A list of related persons who have been omitted is available upon request. The related persons not listed were omitted because they are wholly unrelated to the Adviser?s services and are not considered advisory affiliates. The list of related persons not listed: (1) do not share the same physical location as the Adviser; (2) have no business dealings with the Adviser; (3) do not conduct shared operations with the Adviser; (4) do not refer clients or business to the Adviser; (5) do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser; and (6) do not share supervised persons or premises with the Adviser. The Adviser has no reason to believe that its relationship with the omitted related persons creates a conflict of interest with the Adviser's Advisory Clients. ------------------------------------------ In the Regulatory Action disclosure section, all disclosures over the past ten years have been included. In addition, in an effort to be fully transparent and to be consistent with disclosures the BTG Pactual Group has made to its other international regulators, the following information is being voluntarily disclosed. On July 9, 2014, the former controlling shareholder and former chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (?Banco BTG Pactual?), Andre Santos Esteves, reached an agreement with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance FDF (?FDF?) in connection with an inquiry by the FDF relating to the accidental omission of certain information in statements made to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (?FINMA?) by Mr. Esteves in 2011. Both Banco BTG Pactual and Mr. Esteves are listed as indirect owners of BTG Pactual Global Asset Management Ltd. At the time such omissions were discovered in 2011, Mr. Esteves described to FINMA the rational for the omission and was advised that the matter would not result in any further inquiry or proceeding. The matter was revisited as a result of Banco BTG Pactual's opening of an unregulated commodities business in Switzerland in late 2013. In late 2013, Banco BTG Pactual visited FINMA to confirm its views that such business was not subject to FINMA oversight pursuant to applicable Swiss law and was advised that the matter from 2011 was being revisited. The inquiry centered on Mr. Esteves? accidental failure to disclose an administrative investigation in Italy by the Italian Companies and Stock Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societa e La Borsa) that has previously been disclosed to the SEC in 2012. Mr. Esteves presented his explanations for such omission to the FDF, who determined to terminate its inquiry in exchange for a reparation payment to the Swiss Federation by Mr. Esteves in the amount of CHF 250,000. This matter did not result in any criminal liability whatsoever for Mr. Esteves and the payment is not classified as a fine under the laws of Switzerland. This matter does not rise to the level of a regulatory action and the reparation payment does not meet the definition of a ?finding? or ?administrative sanction? under the definitions outlined in the instructions of Form ADV. Accordingly, no additional disclosures are being made under Item 11"

Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1)A, Item 23: With respect to certain private funds that have been audited by Deloitte, the financial statements are prepared under IFRS.  Regarding the private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7B1: ICG Senior Debt Partners I and ICG Senior Debt Partners II are structured as an ?umbrella fund? as opposed to a ?master-feeder fund?. In an umbrella fund structure, the law of the fund?s local jurisdiction permits the creation of multiple compartments with each compartment linked to a specific portfolio of investments which is segregated from the portfolio of investments of the other compartments. Similarly, each compartment is linked to a group of investors who are separate and distinct from the investors of the other compartments.  Pursuant to this ring-fencing principle, although the umbrella fund constitutes one single legal entity, the assets of a compartment are exclusively available only to satisfy the rights of investors in relation to that compartment and the rights of creditors whose claims have arisen in connection with the operation of that compartment.  Our response in Section 7.B. for the ICG Private Markets Fund SCSP SICAV-RAIF fund is the aggregate value of the four compartments that form  ICG Private Markets Fund SCSP SICAV-RAIF.
