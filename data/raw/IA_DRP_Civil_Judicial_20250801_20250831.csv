AT THE TIME OF THE OUTAGE, DBAG WAS SUBJECT TO A CFTC SETTLEMENT ORDER DATED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, ARISING OUT OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF SWAP REPORTING ERROR, WHICH REQUIRED DBAG TO REMEDIATE ITS SWAP DATA REPORTING PROGRAM. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REMEDIAL UNDERTAKINGS, DBAG ATTEMPTED TO PERFORM A MAINTENANCE UPGRADE TO ITS SWAP REPORTING PLATFORM, DURING WHICH ITS VENDOR CAUSED THE OUTAGE BY INADVERTENTLY COPYING OUTDATED OR UNSYNCHRONIZED DATA FILES FROM THE BACKUP PLATFORM TO THE MAIN PLATFORM.
