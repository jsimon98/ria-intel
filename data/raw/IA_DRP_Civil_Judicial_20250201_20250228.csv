SILVER POINT STRONGLY CONTESTS THESE ALLEGATIONS AND HAS DECLINED TO SETTLE THE SEC'S UNFOUNDED CLAIMS, AS THERE WAS NEITHER ANY WRONGDOING NOR ANY DEFICIENCY IN THE FIRM'S INFORMATION BARRIER POLICIES OR ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, AND THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO CHAPERONE A LAWYER'S COMMUNICATIONS WITH INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS.","Pending","","12/20/2024","Y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","THE SEC ALLEGES THAT SILVER POINT VIOLATED SECTIONS 204A AND 206(4) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (""ADVISERS ACT"") AND RULE 206(4)-7 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER.  THESE PROVISIONS REQUIRE THAT INVESTMENT ADVISERS MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE MISUSE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION (""MNPI"").  THE SEC DID NOT ALLEGE INSIDER TRADING OR ANY IMPROPER LEAKAGE OF MNPI OR THAT THERE WAS ANY HARM TO ANY INVESTORS OR TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY.  INSTEAD, THE SEC ALLEGES INADEQUATE SUPERVISION OF CHAIM FORTGANG, A HIGHLY RESPECTED BANKRUPTCY LAWYER, WHO WAS A LEGAL CONSULTANT TO SILVER POINT UNTIL HIS DEATH THREE YEARS AGO.     AT ALL TIMES WHILE SERVING AS SILVER POINT'S CONSULTANT, MR. FORTGANG WAS ACTING AS AN ATTORNEY PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES.  HE DID NOT PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE OR PERFORM ANY OTHER FUNCTION AKIN TO A SILVER POINT INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE SEC'S INVESTIGATION, NINE CURRENT AND FORMER SILVER POINT EMPLOYEES AND SILVER POINT'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL TESTIFIED TO THE EXCLUSIVELY LEGAL NATURE OF MR. FORTGANG'S ROLE, AND 12 WELL-RESPECTED BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS WHO WORKED WITH MR. FORTGANG DURING HIS YEARS AT SILVER POINT PROVIDED DECLARATIONS TO THE SEC ATTESTING TO THE SOLELY LEGAL NATURE OF HIS WORK.  THE SEC HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ANY WITNESSES WHO DID OR WOULD TESTIFY THAT MR. FORTGANG MAINTAINED A DIFFERENT ROLE.  IN ADDITION, SILVER POINT'S CONTEMPORANEOUS INTERNAL RECORDS FURTHER CONFIRM MR. FORTGANG ACTED SOLELY AS AN ATTORNEY: MR. FORTGANG'S EXPENSES WERE IDENTIFIED AS ""LEGAL"" ON SILVER POINT'S GENERAL LEDGER; IN RESPONSE TO THEIR REQUESTS, MR. FORTGANG PROVIDED LEGAL CONFIRMATION LETTERS TO THE FIRM'S OUTSIDE AUDITOR; AND SILVER POINT EMAILS REGULARLY REFERENCED SEEKING OR OBTAINING MR. FORTGANG'S LEGAL ADVICE.   SINCE THE FIRM'S INCEPTION, AND AS THE SEC RECOGNIZES IN ITS COMPLAINT, SILVER POINT HAS DEDICATED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT ITS STRICT INFORMATION BARRIER POLICY.  THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC SEPARATION OF ""PUBLIC SIDE"" AND ""PRIVATE SIDE"" EMPLOYEES; A RESTRICTED LIST AND WATCH LIST FOR PREVENTING AND MONITORING TRADES IN SPECIFIC SECURITIES; AND ""WALL CROSSING"" PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING, APPROVING, SURVEILLING AND LOGGING PUBLIC-PRIVATE EMPLOYEE CONVERSATIONS.  SILVER POINT'S INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT WITH MR. FORTGANG REQUIRED HIM TO ABIDE BY SILVER POINT'S COMPLIANCE MANUAL, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION BARRIER POLICY (THAT IS, HE WAS REQUIRED NOT TO CONVEY ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO THE FIRM'S PUBLIC SIDE, UNLESS APPROVED BY SILVER POINT'S COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT).  CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICES, SILVER POINT'S POLICIES DID NOT REQUIRE THE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT TO CHAPERONE THE PUBLIC SIDE'S DISCUSSIONS WITH LEGAL ADVISORS, INCLUDING MR. FORTGANG.  THIS IS PRECISELY BECAUSE-CONTRARY TO THE SEC'S CONTENTION-SUCH CONVERSATIONS DO NOT PRESENT ANY RISK THAT MNPI WILL BE CONVEYED IMPROPERLY.  LIKE ALL ATTORNEYS, MR. FORTGANG WAS REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY LEGAL AND ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS NOT TO SHARE MNPI, MEANING HE DID NOT PRESENT A RISK OF MNPI LEAKAGE.  SILVER POINT APPROPRIATELY RELIED ON MR. FORTGANG TO FULFILL HIS CONTRACTUAL, PROFESSIONAL, AND ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS TO SAFEGUARD CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.    SILVER POINT HAS, AT ALL TIMES, BEHAVED LEGALLY AND ETHICALLY.  SILVER POINT TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND SEEKS TO ALWAYS OPERATE WITH THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS.  SILVER POINT INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THE SEC'S CLAIMS, BECAUSE THERE WAS NEITHER ANY WRONGDOING NOR ANY DEFICIENCY IN ITS INFORMATION BARRIER POLICIES OR ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, AND THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO CHAPERONE A LAWYER'S COMMUNICATIONS WITH INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS."

THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA AND ANOTHER FIRM, WHOSE BROKER-DEALER OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO WACHOVIA MISREPRESENTED TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARS WERE SAFE, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT WERE COMPARABLE TO CASH OR MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S COMPLAINT, WACHOVIA REINFORCED THE PERCEPTION OF LIQUIDITY BY ROUTINELY PURCHASING ARS FROM THE OTHER FIRM'S CUSTOMERS BETWEEN AUCTIONS, WITHOUT TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT WACHOVIA'S WILLINGNESS TO DO SO DEPENDED UPON THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE AUCTIONS.

THE SETTLEMENT RESOLVES THE SEC'S CHARGES THAT WACHOVIA MISLED INVESTORS REGARDING THE LIQUIDITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ARS THAT IT UNDERWROTE, MARKETED AND SOLD. THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA AND ANOTHER FIRM, WHOSE BROKER-DEALER OPERATIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO WACHOVIA MISREPRESENTED TO CUSTOMERS THAT ARS WERE SAFE, HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS THAT WERE COMPARABLE TO CASH OR MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS.

THE SEC'S COMPLAINT ALLEGES THAT WACHOVIA BECAME AWARE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT PUT THE FIRM ON NOTICE THAT THE RISK OF AUCTION FAILURES HAD MATERIALLY INCREASED. WACHOVIA, NEVERTHELESS, CONTINUED TO MARKET ARS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AS HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS. WACHOVIA FOLLOWED THE LEAD OF OTHER BROKER-DEALERS AND DECIDED TO STOP SUPPORTING AUCTIONS.

SILVER POINT STRONGLY CONTESTS THESE ALLEGATIONS AND HAS DECLINED TO SETTLE THE SEC'S UNFOUNDED CLAIMS, AS THERE WAS NEITHER ANY WRONGDOING NOR ANY DEFICIENCY IN THE FIRM'S INFORMATION BARRIER POLICIES OR ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, AND THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO CHAPERONE A LAWYER'S COMMUNICATIONS WITH INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS.","Pending","","12/20/2024","Y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","THE SEC ALLEGES THAT SILVER POINT VIOLATED SECTIONS 204A AND 206(4) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 (""ADVISERS ACT"") AND RULE 206(4)-7 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER.  THESE PROVISIONS REQUIRE THAT INVESTMENT ADVISERS MAINTAIN AND ENFORCE WRITTEN POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REASONABLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE MISUSE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION (""MNPI"").  THE SEC DID NOT ALLEGE INSIDER TRADING OR ANY IMPROPER LEAKAGE OF MNPI OR THAT THERE WAS ANY HARM TO ANY INVESTORS OR TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY.  INSTEAD, THE SEC ALLEGES INADEQUATE SUPERVISION OF CHAIM FORTGANG, A HIGHLY RESPECTED BANKRUPTCY LAWYER, WHO WAS A LEGAL CONSULTANT TO SILVER POINT UNTIL HIS DEATH THREE YEARS AGO.     AT ALL TIMES WHILE SERVING AS SILVER POINT'S CONSULTANT, MR. FORTGANG WAS ACTING AS AN ATTORNEY PROVIDING LEGAL SERVICES.  HE DID NOT PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVICE OR PERFORM ANY OTHER FUNCTION AKIN TO A SILVER POINT INVESTMENT PROFESSIONAL.  DURING THE COURSE OF THE SEC'S INVESTIGATION, NINE CURRENT AND FORMER SILVER POINT EMPLOYEES AND SILVER POINT'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL TESTIFIED TO THE EXCLUSIVELY LEGAL NATURE OF MR. FORTGANG'S ROLE, AND 12 WELL-RESPECTED BANKRUPTCY ATTORNEYS WHO WORKED WITH MR. FORTGANG DURING HIS YEARS AT SILVER POINT PROVIDED DECLARATIONS TO THE SEC ATTESTING TO THE SOLELY LEGAL NATURE OF HIS WORK.  THE SEC HAS NOT IDENTIFIED ANY WITNESSES WHO DID OR WOULD TESTIFY THAT MR. FORTGANG MAINTAINED A DIFFERENT ROLE.  IN ADDITION, SILVER POINT'S CONTEMPORANEOUS INTERNAL RECORDS FURTHER CONFIRM MR. FORTGANG ACTED SOLELY AS AN ATTORNEY: MR. FORTGANG'S EXPENSES WERE IDENTIFIED AS ""LEGAL"" ON SILVER POINT'S GENERAL LEDGER; IN RESPONSE TO THEIR REQUESTS, MR. FORTGANG PROVIDED LEGAL CONFIRMATION LETTERS TO THE FIRM'S OUTSIDE AUDITOR; AND SILVER POINT EMAILS REGULARLY REFERENCED SEEKING OR OBTAINING MR. FORTGANG'S LEGAL ADVICE.   SINCE THE FIRM'S INCEPTION, AND AS THE SEC RECOGNIZES IN ITS COMPLAINT, SILVER POINT HAS DEDICATED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT ITS STRICT INFORMATION BARRIER POLICY.  THE FIRM'S POLICIES AND PROCEDURES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PHYSICAL AND ELECTRONIC SEPARATION OF ""PUBLIC SIDE"" AND ""PRIVATE SIDE"" EMPLOYEES; A RESTRICTED LIST AND WATCH LIST FOR PREVENTING AND MONITORING TRADES IN SPECIFIC SECURITIES; AND ""WALL CROSSING"" PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING, APPROVING, SURVEILLING AND LOGGING PUBLIC-PRIVATE EMPLOYEE CONVERSATIONS.  SILVER POINT'S INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT WITH MR. FORTGANG REQUIRED HIM TO ABIDE BY SILVER POINT'S COMPLIANCE MANUAL, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION BARRIER POLICY (THAT IS, HE WAS REQUIRED NOT TO CONVEY ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION TO THE FIRM'S PUBLIC SIDE, UNLESS APPROVED BY SILVER POINT'S COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT).  CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICES, SILVER POINT'S POLICIES DID NOT REQUIRE THE COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT TO CHAPERONE THE PUBLIC SIDE'S DISCUSSIONS WITH LEGAL ADVISORS, INCLUDING MR. FORTGANG.  THIS IS PRECISELY BECAUSE-CONTRARY TO THE SEC'S CONTENTION-SUCH CONVERSATIONS DO NOT PRESENT ANY RISK THAT MNPI WILL BE CONVEYED IMPROPERLY.  LIKE ALL ATTORNEYS, MR. FORTGANG WAS REQUIRED TO ABIDE BY LEGAL AND ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS NOT TO SHARE MNPI, MEANING HE DID NOT PRESENT A RISK OF MNPI LEAKAGE.  SILVER POINT APPROPRIATELY RELIED ON MR. FORTGANG TO FULFILL HIS CONTRACTUAL, PROFESSIONAL, AND ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS TO SAFEGUARD CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.    SILVER POINT HAS, AT ALL TIMES, BEHAVED LEGALLY AND ETHICALLY.  SILVER POINT TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN ITS COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND SEEKS TO ALWAYS OPERATE WITH THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS.
