In addition, as an ERA, the Registrant is not subject to Rule 205­3 under the Advisers Act, and it is not currently subject to a state law equivalent, which would require fund investors to be qualified clients.

We note that we shall amend Form ADV each year by filing an annual updating amendment within 90 days after the end of our fiscal year, this date being 31 March 2025. The annual updating amendment was filed one day after such date due to the failure of having sufficient funds in the FINRA account, which is a condition for filing the amendment. We transferred funds to the FINRA account on 28 March 2025; however, the funds were not available in our FINRA account on 31 March 2025. We initiated a case with FINRA, case number 2789569, to trace the transfer of the funds on 31 March 2025; however, the funds were not traced or found before the end of that day. The funds became available in our FINRA account on the same day this annual updating amendment is filed.  We will ensure sufficient funds are always available in the account in the future and will file the annual updating amendment within the 90-day period from the end of the fiscal year."
