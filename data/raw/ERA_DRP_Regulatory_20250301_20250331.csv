THE ORDER REQUIRES NATIXIS TO PAY A $2.8 MILLION CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, CEASE AND DESIST FROM VIOLATING APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT (CEA) AND CFTC REGULATIONS, AND COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS.   CASE BACKGROUND BETWEEN JANUARY 2015 AND AT LEAST APRIL 2018, A TRADER ON THE BANK'S IRD DESK SUBMITTED FALSE OR MISLEADING ENTRIES IN THE BANK'S INTERNAL RECORDKEEPING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM RELATING TO THE MARKING OF THE END-OF-DAY USD LIBOR FORWARD CURVE (CLOSING CURVE), FOR THE PURPOSE OF INFLATING THE UNREALIZED PROFIT AND LOSS (P&L) OF THE DESK HE MANAGED AND DISGUISING SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES.

ALTHOUGH NATIXIS MAINTAINED CERTAIN CONTROLS RELATING TO THE MARKING OF THE CLOSING CURVE, THOSE CONTROLS WERE INSUFFICIENT TO DETECT THE TRADER'S MISCONDUCT FOR OVER THREE YEARS. AT ITS PEAK IN EARLY 2018, THE TRADER'S MISMARKING OF THE CLOSING CURVE OVERSTATED THE P&L OF THE IRD DESK BY APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE ORDER FURTHER FINDS THAT NATIXIS FAILED TO DILIGENTLY SUPERVISE THE ACTIVITIES OF ITS FAST DESK. SPECIFICALLY, BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2017 AND NOVEMBER 2019, TRADERS ON THE FAST DESK MADE CERTAIN MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BANK'S INTERNAL TRADE BOOKING SYSTEMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ""SMOOTHING"" OR HIDING THE FAST DESK'S P&L AND LATER RELEASING THE P&L DURING DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS.  AT ITS PEAK, THE P&L SMOOTHING UNDERSTATED THE UNREALIZED P&L OF THE FAST DESK BY OVER $6 MILLION. THIS MISCONDUCT RENDERED THE BANK'S BOOKS AND RECORDS INACCURATE.  IN ACCEPTING THE BANK'S OFFER OF SETTLEMENT, THE CFTC RECOGNIZED ITS SUBSTANTIAL COOPERATION DURING THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT'S INVESTIGATION OF THIS MATTER.

THE ORDER REQUIRES NATIXIS TO PAY A $2.8 MILLION CIVIL MONETARY PENALTY, CEASE AND DESIST FROM VIOLATING APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT (CEA) AND CFTC REGULATIONS, AND COMPLY WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND UNDERTAKINGS.   CASE BACKGROUND  BETWEEN JANUARY 2015 AND AT LEAST APRIL 2018, A TRADER ON THE BANK'S IRD DESK SUBMITTED FALSE OR MISLEADING ENTRIES IN THE BANK'S INTERNAL RECORDKEEPING AND ACCOUNTING SYSTEM RELATING TO THE MARKING OF THE END-OF-DAY USD LIBOR FORWARD CURVE (CLOSING CURVE), FOR THE PURPOSE OF INFLATING THE UNREALIZED PROFIT AND LOSS (P&L) OF THE DESK HE MANAGED AND DISGUISING SIGNIFICANT TRADING LOSSES. SPECIFICALLY, THE TRADER ENGAGED IN A PATTERN OF MARKING THE CLOSING CURVE IN A MANNER THAT VARIED FROM OBSERVED BROKER MID PRICES AND IN A MANNER THAT ALIGNED WITH THE RISK POSITIONS OF THE IRD DESK, WHILE GENERALLY STAYING WITHIN THE LIMITS OF INTERNAL CONTROLS DESIGNED TO DETECT MISMARKING. ALTHOUGH NATIXIS MAINTAINED CERTAIN CONTROLS RELATING TO THE MARKING OF THE CLOSING CURVE, THOSE CONTROLS WERE INSUFFICIENT TO DETECT THE TRADER'S MISCONDUCT FOR OVER THREE YEARS. AT ITS PEAK IN EARLY 2018, THE TRADER'S MISMARKING OF THE CLOSING CURVE OVERSTATED THE P&L OF THE IRD DESK BY APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION.  IN ADDITION, THE ORDER FURTHER FINDS THAT NATIXIS FAILED TO DILIGENTLY SUPERVISE THE ACTIVITIES OF ITS FAST DESK. SPECIFICALLY, BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2017 AND NOVEMBER 2019, TRADERS ON THE FAST DESK MADE CERTAIN MANUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BANK'S INTERNAL TRADE BOOKING SYSTEMS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ""SMOOTHING"" OR HIDING THE FAST DESK'S P&L AND LATER RELEASING THE P&L DURING DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS.  AT ITS PEAK, THE P&L SMOOTHING UNDERSTATED THE UNREALIZED P&L OF THE FAST DESK BY OVER $6 MILLION. THIS MISCONDUCT RENDERED THE BANK'S BOOKS AND RECORDS INACCURATE.   IN ACCEPTING THE BANK'S OFFER OF SETTLEMENT, THE CFTC RECOGNIZED ITS SUBSTANTIAL COOPERATION DURING THE DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT'S INVESTIGATION OF THIS MATTER.
