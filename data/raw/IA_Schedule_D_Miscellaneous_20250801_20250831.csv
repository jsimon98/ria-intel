On August 26, 2024, Sound Point agreed to a settlement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") to settle administrative proceeding file No. 3-22032. The SEC alleged that, prior to July 2022, Sound Point?s written policies and procedures regarding the prevention of misuse of potentially material non-public information were not sufficiently implemented and enforced in certain circumstances when Sound Point traded the tranches of collateralized loan obligations it managed. The SEC noted that Sound Point conducted compliance reviews prior to trades in tranches of collateralized loan obligations after July 2019, but alleged that Sound Point had not established, maintained or enforced written policies and procedures in respect of such reviews prior to July 2022. The SEC also alleged that, prior to June 2024, Sound Point?s written policies and procedures regarding the prevention of misuse of potentially material non-public information were not sufficiently implemented and enforced in certain circumstances when Sound Point traded the tranches of collateralized loan obligations managed by third parties.  Pursuant to an offer of settlement, the SEC found, and Sound Point neither admitted nor denied, that Sound Point violated Sections 204A and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-7 thereunder. The settlement included a censure and a civil penalty of $1.8 million. This matter did not include any findings of insider trading or misuse of material non-public information by Sound Point or its employees. Sound Point fully cooperated with the SEC in this matter, which related only to the implementation of certain compliance policies and procedures, the majority of which were modified in 2019."

The following affiliate is filing as a relying adviser as defined in the ABA Letter: BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, LLC. ------------------------------------------ In response to Items 5(A) and 5(B), the Adviser has included the number of employees as of the fiscal year end. Employees that perform clerical work were excluded from all calculations in accordance with Staff guidance.  Certain consultants and/or outsourced personnel that do not perform clerical work are included in the calculations. ------------------------------------------ In response to Item 5(E) ?

A list of related persons who have been omitted is available upon request. The related persons not listed were omitted because they are wholly unrelated to the Adviser?s services and are not considered advisory affiliates.

The Adviser has no reason to believe that its relationship with the omitted related persons creates a conflict of interest with the Adviser's Advisory Clients. ------------------------------------------ In the Regulatory Action disclosure section, all disclosures over the past ten years have been included.  In addition, in an effort to be fully transparent and to be consistent with disclosures the BTG Pactual Group has made to its other international regulators, the following information is being voluntarily disclosed.  On July 9, 2014, the former controlling shareholder and former chief executive officer of Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (?Banco BTG Pactual?), Andre Santos Esteves, reached an agreement with the Swiss Federal Department of Finance FDF (?FDF?) in connection with an inquiry by the FDF relating to the accidental omission of certain information in statements made to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (?FINMA?) by Mr. Esteves in 2011. Both Banco BTG Pactual and Mr. Esteves are listed as indirect owners of BTG Pactual Asset Management US, LLC. At the time such omissions were discovered in 2011, Mr. Esteves described to FINMA the rational for the omission and was advised that the matter would not result in any further inquiry or proceeding. The matter was revisited as a result of Banco BTG Pactual's opening of an unregulated commodities business in Switzerland in late 2013. In late 2013, Banco BTG Pactual visited FINMA to confirm its views that such business was not subject to FINMA oversight pursuant to applicable Swiss law and was advised that the matter from 2011 was being revisited. The inquiry centered on Mr. Esteves? accidental failure to disclose an administrative investigation in Italy by the Italian Companies and Stock Exchange Commission (Commissione Nazionale per le Societa e La Borsa) that has previously been disclosed to the SEC in 2012. Mr. Esteves presented his explanations for such omission to the FDF, who determined to terminate its inquiry in exchange for a reparation payment to the Swiss Federation by Mr. Esteves in the amount of CHF 250,000. This matter did not result in any criminal liability whatsoever for Mr. Esteves and the payment is not classified as a fine under the laws of Switzerland. This matter does not rise to the level of a regulatory action and the reparation payment does not meet the definition of a ?finding? or ?administrative sanction? under the definitions outlined in the instructions of Form ADV.  Accordingly, no additional disclosures are being made under Item 11."

In each case, when we commence reporting of performance to investors, we will report an aggregate return to investors based on the consolidated performance of both Master Funds. We believe this approach better reflects how investors view the investment (i.e., as an investment into one fund based on one capital commitment rather than an investment into multiple funds).  GoldenTree has six affiliated, U.S.-based relying advisers, GoldenTree Loan Management, LP (""GLM Master"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM, LP (""GLM Sub"" and together with ""GLM Master"", collectively ?GLM?), GoldenTree Loan Management II LP (""GLM Master II"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM II, LP (""GLM Sub II"" and together with ""GLM Master II"", collectively ?GLM II?) and GoldenTree Loan Management III LP (""GLM Master III"") and its wholly-owned subsidiary GLM III, LP (""GLM Sub III"" and together with ""GLM Master III"", collectively ?GLM III?).

1997489,"Item 5F - Regulatory Assets Under Management (""RAUM""). Concentric is an affiliate of Pathstone Family Office, LLC (?Pathstone?) because of common control and ownership. Effective as of 6/30/2025, Concentric and Pathstone have entered into a shared services agreement (the ?Shared Services Agreement?) whereas Pathstone provides certain administrative and operational services to Concentric such as business support, information technology, human resources, vendor coordination, legal, compliance and trading support services solely for the internal benefit of Concentric. Pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, certain human resources and trading support services related to fixed income securities and tax managed accounts of certain Pathstone advisory clients are managed by Pathstone employees allocated to Concentric. As a result, such individuals responsible for certain trading related activities out of the Philadelphia Metro office will be dual registered under Concentric and Pathstone and the regulatory assets under management (?RAUM?) associated with these individuals will be reflected in both firms? Form ADVs. For this other than annual amendment, Concentric did not update Item 5F RAUM, but will reflect these changes in its next annual amendment. However, the amount of attributable RAUM to the Philadelphia Metro Office as of 6/30/2025 is $5,566,500,000. We are affiliated with Pathstone, and some of our employees are also registered with Pathstone. These relationships and dual registrations may create conflicts of interest in how we allocate resources. We have adopted policies to manage these potential conflicts; please see our Form ADV, Part 2A for additional information.  SECTION 7.A. Concentric is affiliated with Pathstone Family Office, LLC (?Pathstone?) and Pathstone?s other related entities through common control and ownership. Such other affiliated entities include, Willow Street Trust Company of Wyoming, LLC, Willow Street Group, LLC, Laurel Trust Company, and Cambrian Capital Management, LLC. These entities are identified in Section 7.A. However, Concentric is also affiliated with a supplementary list of related persons who are not listed in Section 7.A that are related to Pathstone?s affiliated fund program and their related entities, such as general partners, investment managers and other fund related affiliated entities (?Related Persons?). A list can be provided of these Related Persons but they are not listed on Section 7.A due to the following reasons: (1) Concentric has no business dealings with these Related Persons in connection with advisory services we provide to our clients; (2) Concentric does not conduct shared operations with these Related Persons; (3) Concentric does not refer clients or business to the Related Persons, and the Related Persons do not refer prospective clients or business to us; (4) Concentric does not share supervised persons or premises with the Related Persons; and (5) Concentric has no reason to believe that our relationship with the Related Persons otherwise creates a conflict of interest with our clients. Additional information - Willow Street Trust Company of Wyoming, LLC (""WSTC, LLC"") and Willow Street Group, LLC (""WSG, LLC"") (collectively, ""Willow Street?) provide professional solutions for the administration, management, and stewardship of assets. Pathstone is affiliated by common control and ownership with Willow Street. Please note that WSTC, LLC is a trust company and WSG, LLC is a fiduciary services firm and not a trust company. Schedule B ? Indirect Owners - In aggregate, pooled investment vehicles controlled and/or managed by Lovell Minnick Partners LLC (?LMP?) hold an indirect interest in Pathstone Holdings LLC of greater than 25%. However, no single LMP managed/controlled entity owns more than the 25% which would trigger disclosure. As a result, and in accordance with the Schedule B?s instructions, no Lovell Minnick entities are required to be disclosed on Schedule B."

2010851,"Focus Partners Advisor Solutions, LLC (""FPAS"") is part of the Focus Financial Partners, LLC (?Focus LLC?) partnership. Specifically, FPAS is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Focus LLC. Focus Financial Partners Inc. is the sole managing member of Focus LLC. Ultimate governance of Focus LLC is conducted through the board of directors at Ferdinand FFP Ultimate Holdings, LP. Focus LLC is majority-owned, indirectly and collectively, by investment vehicles affiliated with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (?CD&R?). Investment vehicles affiliated with Stone Point Capital LLC (?Stone Point?) are indirect owners of Focus LLC. Because FPAS is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Focus LLC, CD&R and Stone Point investment vehicles are indirect owners of FPAS.   Focus LLC also owns other registered investment advisers, broker-dealers, pension consultants, insurance firms, business managers and other firms (the ?Focus Partners?), most of which provide wealth management, benefit consulting and investment consulting services to individuals, families, employers, and institutions. Some Focus Partners also manage or advise limited partnerships, private funds, or investment companies as disclosed on their respective Form ADVs. Some Focus Affiliates also manage or advise limited partnerships, private funds or limited liability companies as disclosed on their respective Form ADVs.   Pursuant to the Form ADV Part 1, Section 7.A instructions, FPAS has not completed Section 7.A of Schedule D for certain Focus Affiliates based on the 7.A Schedule D instruction criteria. The firm maintains a list of related persons who are not listed in Section 7.A because (1) the firm has no business dealings with the related person in connection with the advisory services it provides to clients; (2) it does not conduct shared operations with the related person; (3) it does not refer clients or business to the related person, and the related person does not refer prospective clients or business to the firm; (4) the firm does not share supervised persons or premises with the related person; and (5) the firm has no reason to believe that its relationship with the related person otherwise creates a conflict of interest with its clients.  FPAS provides third-party portfolio management and administrative services for both affiliated and unaffiliated investment advisers and broker dealers. Item 5.D(d) ? FPAS serves as investment adviser to the SA Funds ? Investment Trust, an investment company that is utilized as a component of asset allocation models in which many of FPAS other clients have invested. To more accurately portray FPAS?s clientele and avoid double counting client assets, FPAS has allocated the amounts invested in the SA Funds by FPAS?s other clients in their respective categories.  Item 9. Custody reported under Item 9.A.2 is for third-party standing letters of authorization/instructions (SLOAs) permitting transfers to accounts that custodians characterize as third party, including where a custodian characterizes as third party when the client is a beneficial owner of the destination account. Due to the fact that FPAS provides turnkey asset management services, the total number listed in Item 9.A.2 b. for clients is on an account level. An annual surprise examination was not obtained in reliance on the SEC No-Action Letter to the Investment Adviser Association dated February 21, 2017.

2006889,"In response to Section 7.A of Schedule D. Due to various investment structures globally, Hines has an extensive number of affiliates serving as General Partners, managing members or similar as necessary for certain real estate operating companies (each a ""REOC"" developing or operating physical real estate) and other that pertain to the governance of those legal structures.  There are a large number of these entities, and they are generally not considered to be clients of the advisor.  In addition, most of which do not serve in the GP or similar capacity for pooled investment vehicles, rather they serve as tax blockers, or other types of holding entities for the ownership of interests in real estate.  In addition, each REOC has a dedicated general partner for its structure.  Most of these special purpose vehicles are not used in relation to the business of the pooled investment vehicles managed by Hines Capital Advisors and do not pose a conflict of interest regarding the advisory services of Hines Capital Advisors.  Given the large number of such entities, they are not all listed in 7A, however we maintain a list of those GP's or similar entities which is available on request.  In response to Item 9.F. the qualified custodians for the private funds listed in Section 7.B.(2) of Schedule D have a variety of bank accounts holding cash as necessary, and are not included in the count due to the voluminous number, but a list can be made available upon request.

While investment advisory related decisions are made from the US, some of our offices located outside of North America include small numbers of personnel who are associated with our investment advisory activities.  A list of those offices and personnel is available to the SEC upon request.  Please note the fund listed in 7.B.2 is co-managed with Rialto Capital Management, LLC (SEC# 801-74178).

For these private funds, the Registrant has provided information that was available to it. For certain private funds, the Registrant obtains information requested in Section 7.B of Schedule D from third parties without independent verification. For certain private funds, the manager may waive the minimum investment requirement at its discretion. For certain private funds, the minimum investment requirement may be provided in a currency other than U.S. dollars. For certain sub-advised foreign public funds, which are not primarily intended for U.S. investors, the Registrant has not treated such funds as private funds for purposes of Section 7.B of Schedule D.

The affiliate is deemed under the federal securities laws to have custody of the cash and securities of the funds.

The Goldman Sachs Asset Management business is supported by many Goldman Sachs employees who fulfill a number of different functions that are shared across the Registrant and multiple advisory affiliates. Approximately 3353 employees of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., the Registrant?s ultimate parent, provide services to the Registrant and its advisory affiliates but are not included in Item 5.A of this ADV.

Because FPAS is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Focus LLC, CD&R and Stone Point investment vehicles are indirect owners of FPAS.   Focus LLC also owns other registered investment advisers, broker-dealers, pension consultants, insurance firms, business managers and other firms (the ?Focus Partners?), most of which provide wealth management, benefit consulting and investment consulting services to individuals, families, employers, and institutions. Some Focus Partners also manage or advise limited partnerships, private funds, or investment companies as disclosed on their respective Form ADVs. Some Focus Affiliates also manage or advise limited partnerships, private funds or limited liability companies as disclosed on their respective Form ADVs.   Pursuant to the Form ADV Part 1, Section 7.A instructions, FPAS has not completed Section 7.A of Schedule D for certain Focus Affiliates based on the 7.A Schedule D instruction criteria. The firm maintains a list of related persons who are not listed in Section 7.A because (1) the firm has no business dealings with the related person in connection with the advisory services it provides to clients; (2) it does not conduct shared operations with the related person; (3) it does not refer clients or business to the related person, and the related person does not refer prospective clients or business to the firm; (4) the firm does not share supervised persons or premises with the related person; and (5) the firm has no reason to believe that its relationship with the related person otherwise creates a conflict of interest with its clients.  FPAS provides third-party portfolio management and administrative services for both affiliated and unaffiliated investment advisers and broker dealers. Item 5.D(d) ? FPAS serves as investment adviser to the SA Funds ? Investment Trust, an investment company that is utilized as a component of asset allocation models in which many of FPAS other clients have invested. To more accurately portray FPAS?s clientele and avoid double counting client assets, FPAS has allocated the amounts invested in the SA Funds by FPAS?s other clients in their respective categories.  Item 9. Custody reported under Item 9.A.2 is for third-party standing letters of authorization/instructions (SLOAs) permitting transfers to accounts that custodians characterize as third party, including where a custodian characterizes as third party when the client is a beneficial owner of the destination account. Due to the fact that FPAS provides turnkey asset management services, the total number listed in Item 9.A.2 b. for clients is on an account level. An annual surprise examination was not obtained in reliance on the SEC No-Action Letter to the Investment Adviser Association dated February 21, 2017. The date utilized for the reported custody data for third-party SLOAs was 2/10/2025 for Schwab, 2/10/2025 Fidelity, and 2/18/2025 for Pershing. Assets that were previously held at TD Ameritrade, Inc. are now custodied at Charles Schwab & Co., Inc."

2000153,"Schedule B Indirect Owners: In regard to the indirect beneficial ownership of ACA by the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board d/b/a CPP Investments (""CPP Investments""), CPP Investments is ultimate parent in the Antares Capital Advisers LLC (?ACA?) organizational structure.  ACA has no other beneficial owners with a 25% or greater ownership interest.  CPP Investments, a Canadian Crown corporation, is a professional investment management organization that invests the assets of the Canada Pension Plan not currently needed to pay pension, disability and survivor benefits. Oversight of CPP Investments is provided by an independent Board of Directors appointed by the Canadian and Provincial governments.  CPP Investments eight directors are appointed by Canada?s federal Finance Minister in consultation with the participating provinces, and with the assistance of a nominating committee.  Given that CPP Investments is a state-owned enterprise and as there is no further level of ownership to report , treat it as the equivalent of a public reporting company for purposes of Schedule B.   Schedule B Indirect Owners: Antares Holdings LP holds 100% of the economic interest and all of the voting interests in Antares Midco Inc. other than certain director voting shares held by 9165860 Canada Inc., which has executed a shareholder agreement with CPP Investments pursuant to which, 9165860 Canada Inc. has, agreed to vote and dispose of its director voting shares according to Antares Holdings LP's direction.  Item 9 Custody:  From time to time, ACA may be deemed to have ?custody? of client assets within the meaning of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Investment Adviser Act of 1940, as amended (?Advisers Act?) in instances where Antares Capital LP, a related person of ACA, serves as the administrative agent for lenders, including clients of ACA (?ACA Clients? and the portion of such loans held by ACA Clients, ?ACA Client Loans?).  Others, including ACA affiliates and third-parties also invest in those loans for which Antares Capital acts as administrative agent (?Other Lenders?).  Additionally, Antares Capital serves as administrative agent for loans that are held only by Other Lenders (?Other Loans? and, together with the portion of a loan that is held by an Other Lender where another portion of the loan is an ACA Client Loan, ?Other Loans?).  As administrative agent, Antares Capital LP will, among other things, collect and/or distribute interest, principal and other payments from the borrowers to the ACA Clients and the co-lenders, as well as perform a variety of other administrative functions.  Funds attributable to ACA Client Loans (such portion, ?Client Funds?) and Other Loans (such portion, ?Other Funds?) are commingled in one or more bank accounts over which Antares Capital has authority (each an ?Agent Account?), currently at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas .  No loans are held in the Agent Account. In a December 20, 2018, letter to Madison Capital Funding LLC (the ?Madison Letter?), the Staff indicated that an Agent Account maintained by an affiliate which holds Client Funds constitutes custody for purposes of Rule 206(4)-2 under the Advisers Act.  In light of the Madison Letter, the Adviser now considers itself to have custody over the Client Funds in the Agent Account.  However, the amount of funds in the Agent Account will vary on a daily basis as daily cash flow from underlying borrowers is fluid.  As it can be difficult to determine the portion of the Agent Account that constitutes Client Funds versus Other Funds at any given time, our response to Item 9.B.(2)(a) includes, in addition to other assets for which we have custody, the total amount of funds held in the Agent Account at close of business on December 31, 2022, not all of which is necessarily Client Funds.  In contrast, our response to Item 9.B.(2)(b) represents the number of ACA Clients for which we have custody, whether as a result of holding loans serviced by our related person as of that date or otherwise, even though not all such ACA Clients will necessarily have Client Funds in the Agent Account as of such date.  Section 7.B.(1) Private Fund Reporting: Antares Institutional Loan Master Fund LP, Antares Credit Opportunities VII LLC , Antares Senior Loan Master Fund III LP, and Antares Senior Loan Parallel Master III Fund LP are funds established during 2024 and as a result was not yet subject to an audit in 2024. Due to the sub-advisory nature of ACA?s mandate for the CLOs, certain information regarding beneficial ownership necessary to respond to questions 13 to 16 may be unavailable to ACA.    Responses to questions 13 to 16 for Antares CLO 2017-1, LTD, Antares CLO 2017-2, LTD, Antares CLO 2018-1, LTD, Antares CLO 2018-2, LTD, Antares CLO 2018-3, Ltd , Antares CLO 2019-1, Ltd., Antares CLO 2019-2, Ltd., Antares CLO 2020-1, Ltd., Antares CLO 2021-1, Ltd., Antares CLO 2023-1 Ltd., Antares CLO 2023-2, Ltd, Orion CLO 2023-1 Ltd.,  Orion CLO 2023-2 Ltd., Orion CLO 2024-3 Ltd., Orion CLO 2024-4 Ltd. and Antares CLO 2024-6, Ltd . represent ACA?s reasonable belief at the time of this filing."

AWH does not provide to other persons for compensation any advice about the value of securities or whether to purchase or sell securities.  Nonetheless, based on SEC and Staff guidance, AWH meets the definition of ?investment adviser? under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the ?Advisers Act?) because in recommending third-party investment advisers it is considered to be ?advising others? within the meaning of Section 202(a)(11) of the Advisers Act.  In addition, due to variations in the definition of ?investment adviser? in state securities laws and regulations, AWH is subject to registration as an investment adviser in at least 15 states and therefore is eligible to register with the SEC pursuant to Rule 203A-2(d) under the Advisers Act.  The number of clients set forth in Item 5.C(1) is as of December 31, 2024 and represents clients of AWH that have not yet been onboarded by another registered investment adviser (""RIA"") for which AWH solicits clients.

2011809,"SPECIAL INFORMATION REGARDING STEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS NOVEL CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC:  The Firm has deployed its disaster recovery/business continuity plan, as amended, to assure the maintenance of the Firm's operations in response to the Covid-19 crisis, and has in some cases gone beyond the processes stipulated in the plan, given the unusual nature of the Covid-19 threat (for example, we have educated staff about the dangers of infection, established work protocols to reduce the risks of in-office transmission of the virus, etc.). All staff members and consultants were, initially, working remotely and addressing normal client servicing, portfolio management, operations, administration, and risk issues via regularly scheduled or ad hoc one-to-one or group communications via both internet and intranet-based solutions. In addition, plans were drafted to address the potential infection (and subsequent illness) of staff members, managers, supervisors, and principals so that their duties can be assumed by others in the Firm, and so that clear reporting lines can be maintained. Since the commencement of the pandemic in early 2020, all of the Firm?s operations have been handled without any significant disruptions.  OTHER INFORMATION  (1) Saranac CLO Management, LLC (""Saranac"") (an affiliated company of Canaras Capital Management, LLC (""Canaras"")) is registered as a ""relying adviser."" Canaras and Saranac are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC's response to a January 18, 2012 letter sent to the SEC's Division of Investment Management by the American Bar Association (Re: Registration of Related Persons under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 . . . by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act . . .).    (2) Total assets under management may fluctuate from time to time due to market conditions and the addition and deletion of accounts.  (3) Information as to the number and location (domicile) of investors in any of the funds may change due to sale of interests to other parties. Canaras may not track such sales or assignments. CLO notes are listed on Euronext Dublin. Sales and assignments of notes in CLOs differs from those of hedge funds. Offerings of CLO notes and equity are pursuant to their own offering memoranda and are effected through the respective dealers. Such dealers are required, under applicable FINRA and other legal requirements, to perform anti-money laundering and know your customer reviews on subscribers to CLO securities.  (4) The number of investment-related professionals is determined by assessing the involvement in portfolio decisions of each employee, and the number may fluctuate from time to time.  (5) With respect to certain CLO clients, while Canaras and Saranac have discretion to select assets for the client portfolios, trustees may veto investments if they believe that they are outside of the parameters prescribed by governing documents (such as indentures).  (6) The firm has no plans to engage in principal transactions with clients, but such may be warranted or result from structuring complex client transactions in the future.  (7) Assets Under Management (AUM) includes assets being managed during ramp-up of new CLOs, as the firm is operating under a collateral management agreement.  (8)  Cyber Security Risk - The IT systems of Canaras, its affiliates, and of service providers to its clients may be vulnerable to potential damage or interruption from computer viruses, network failures, computer and telecommunication failures, infiltration by unauthorized persons (who may be both malevolent and highly sophisticated) and security breaches, power outages and catastrophic events. Although Canaras has implemented various measures designed to manage risks relating to these types of events, if these systems are compromised, become inoperable for extended periods of time or cease to function properly, it may be necessary for Canaras (and/or its service providers) to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and to seek to remedy the effect of these issues. The failure of these systems and/or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in Canaras's operations or its client accounts and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information.  (9) Saranac Management Limited and Saranac Investment Management IC (both registered in Jersey, Channel Islands) are listed on Schedule A. They hold NON-VOTING interests in Saranac CLO Management, LLC. The interests held are for limited purposes connected with certain risk retention obligations under laws of the European Union in connection with certain CLO deals/offerings. The identifier numbers on Schedule A are their Jersey (Channel Islands) corporate registration numbers.   (10) Neither Saranac nor Canaras has ""clients"" who are ""retail investors"" as those terms are defined under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and under Regulation BI, nor is either firm expected to have clients who are retail investors in the foreseeable future.  (11) The receipt of audited financials for private investment companies may lag certain updating amendments to this form, or the filing of amendments may not coincide with the earlier receipt of such financials. Generally, the funds expect to receive unqualified reports. While the funds expect that audits will be completed within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year, there may be harder to value assets in the portfolio that may cause a delay in the completion of the audits. As for CLOs managed by the firm, they are not audited (though new rules may require audits), but their operations rely upon agreed upon procedures to assure the accuracy and integrity of financial records. The SEC has recently proposed rules that will require the CLOs are also audited; however, the proposed rules are not expected to become effective, if adopted, imminently.  (12) Notwithstanding other information herein under Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the PCAOB-auditor for Canaras Credit Opportunities LLC (805-7647734239) has not yet been selected. The third-party fund administrator for Canaras Credit Opportunities LLC (805-7647734239) has not yet been selected.  (13) A loan in the amount of $2 million, effected in March of 2021, exists between a senior firm executive and the firm. The purpose of the loan was to assure that the firm is able to meet certain European retention (""skin in the game"") requirements in connection with certain CLO transactions. The loan has triggers for repayment to the executive by the firm. These triggers include: (a) The firm's failure to make full and timely payment of the amounts due on any Payment Date or the Maturity Date and the failure to remedy such payment default within fourteen calendar days; or (b) The departure of Anthony R. Clemente as Chief Executive Officer of the firm; or (c) The reduction of Anthony R. Clemente's direct or indirect ownership of the firm to less than 50%; or (d) The filing of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy petition with respect to the firm in any court of competent jurisdiction.  (14) Presently, the firm is not in a ""precarious financial condition,"" nor is such condition foreseen in the near future. Should such a condition obtain, clients will be informed."

Bratton Capital Management, L.P. is also a Relying Adviser; it and Bratton Capital, Inc. are related persons of Filing Adviser and serve as general partners to or manage limited partnerships that are not listed in response to section 7.B.(2). of this Schedule D because they are special purpose vehicles for family office investments managed by Bratton Capital Management, L.P. (as opposed to investment vehicles offered by the Filing Adviser). The Filing Adviser agrees to provide a list of such limited partnerships and their general partners upon request.  Crestline Associates Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of the Filing Adviser, has an indirect ownership interest in Crestline Denali Capital, LLC (?Denali?). As such, principal owners of the Filing Adviser have an indirect ownership interest in Denali. The Filing Adviser has direct and indirect ownership interests of SummitTX Capital, L.P. (?SummitTX?), a separately registered investment adviser. Assets under management amounts are as of December 31, 2024, March 31, 2025, and June 30, 2025, as applicable, and include estimates where final values were not yet available. Investment funds were added to or removed from Schedule 7.B.(1) if they were launched or closed in 2025. The stated minimum investment amounts may be lower for certain investors. The Reporting Funds Crestline Opportunity Fund III (Europe) Master Fund D SCSP, Crestline Opportunity IV Master Fund, L.P., Crestline Opportunity Fund V Master Fund, L.P. and Crestline StepStone Opportunistic Credit Master Fund I, L.P. are each part of fund structures where there are multiple ""Master"" funds to various ""Feeder"" funds. Capital commitments from investors into those ""Feeder"" funds can ultimately be invested into any of the Master Funds within the respective Master-Feeder structure, depending on the characteristics of the underlying investments. Since we do not expect these ""Feeder? funds to invest substantially all of their assets into any of the ?Master? funds, we do not characterize the relationship as a Master-Feeder relationship per Form ADV instructions. In each case, when we commence reporting of performance to investors, we will report an aggregate return to investors based on the consolidated performance of all of the related master funds. We believe this approach better reflects how investors view the investment (i.e., as an investment into one fund based on one capital commitment rather than an investment into multiple funds).  Each of CL Commonwealth, Inc. and CL Trading, L.P. is an SPV which we treat as a fund due to the SEC?s guidance on application of the custody rule to SPVs which include managed accounts as investors in the SPVs.  Aggregate returns are reported to the investors in the funds or managed accounts comprising the investors in these SPVs, but separate returns by investment are not reported. CL Recovery Trading Fund III, L.P. has taken certain corporate actions to facilitate the sale or liquidation of certain positions in connection with its winding down. For funds launched in 2024 we answer ?yes? to question 23(g) in schedule 7.B.(1) as it is expected audited financial statements will be distributed to the respective private funds? investors for the fiscal year. Lastly, in response to item 5.E.(7) certain client accounts pay the investment manager for certain investment manager expenses as disclosed in the relevant account documentation."

The fees payable to River Road may be reduced by the amount of certain shareholder servicing fees, distribution related expenses, and other expenses paid by AMG Funds LLC on behalf of the funds, under an agreement by which River Road has agreed to reimburse AMG Funds LLC for a certain portion of these fees. In addition, one River Road employee is a registered representative of AMG Distributors, Inc., a limited purpose broker-dealer that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMG Funds LLC and that is the underwriter of the AMG Funds family of funds and placement agent for certain affiliate private funds.

Avalon PE Investments, L.P., was initially a separately managed account created as a limited partnership for an institutional client in a pool of private assets. It was subsequently changed to a fund as the institutional client transferred its entire interest in the vehicle to other clients and two external parties. Likewise, Nova Private Equity Partners II, L.P, Nova Private Equity Partners III, L.P, Nova Private Equity Partners IV, L.P are reported as funds because they include an external party as an investor.

Certain other Partners and employees own minority stakes in the firm (<25%), which may increase based on the attainment of specific assets under management (""AUM"") targets.  The realization of AUM targets will result in Andrew E. Canter's firm ownership incrementally decreasing as triggered by employee equity compensation. (Please refer to Item 10:  Other Financial Industry Activities & Affiliations for further details, and Form ADV Part 2Bs for Principal Owners' formal education and business backgrounds.)  ITEM 10:  Other Financial Industry Activities & Affiliations Real Estate Broker Or Dealer  Canter Wealth HoldCo, LLC, is an owner of Canter Wealth. Canter Wealth HoldCo, LLC is wholly owned by The Canter Group, LLC.  The Canter Group, LLC is wholly owned by Canter Holdings, LLC, wholly owned by Andrew E. Canter, through a Trust.     The Canter Group operates a range of businesses through controlled entities, collectively referred to as the ""Canter Companies,"" described below.  To the extent clients of Canter Wealth also use one or more of the Canter Companies' services, the activities and fees of the Canter Companies will be important to understand.  Canter Wealth advisory clients should be aware that when they are using the services of affiliated entities of Canter Wealth, such services are not provided by Canter Wealth, are subject to separate contractual arrangements, and are not part of the advisory services offered by Canter Wealth.  Moreover, the protections afforded to a client under applicable investment advisory laws and regulations generally do not apply to the services provided by non-advisory affiliates. From time to time and when appropriate for a client, Advisor Representatives of Canter Wealth will recommend that such clients consider other affiliated Canter Companies' services. Personnel of other Canter Companies also retain the discretion to introduce non-advisory clients to Canter Wealth.  This presents a conflict of interest since the Canter Group, LLC, will receive additional compensation if a Canter Wealth advisory client elects to utilize another of the Canter Companies' services.    The following are affiliated businesses owned and operated by the Canter Companies: ?Canter Management, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is in the business of managing real estate holdings. ?Canter Capital, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, seeks private investment opportunities related to Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Private Real Estate Investments.   ?Canter Development, LLC - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is a real estate developer currently active in the San Diego market. ?Iconic Property Management, Inc. - A Canter Group subsidiary is a real estate property manager. ?Canter Real Estate Group, Inc. - a subsidiary of The Canter Group, is a pass-through entity partnered with an independent and unaffiliated real estate brokerage firm (Compass).  Certain Canter Wealth's Advisor Representatives are licensed real estate agents of an independent and unaffiliated real-estate brokerage and agency.  Advisor Representatives offer clients advice or services from Canter Companies or other non-related parties from time to time.  The ultimate decision to retain these particular services remains within the sole discretion of the client. Clients should be aware that these services involve a conflict of interest due to the additional compensation received in connection with the transaction. Canter Wealth addresses this conflict of interest by requiring Associates to always act in each client's best interests and fully disclose such relationships when making recommendations.  Associates satisfy this requirement by advising clients of the nature of the transaction or relationship, noting their role in the transaction, and disclosing any compensation to be received by them in connection with the transaction, including commissions and trails, if applicable.     Other Material Relationships or Arrangements With The Financial Industry Stifel Effective March 2019, Canter Wealth entered into a relationship with Stifel, a registered broker-dealer and self-clearing firm (member NYSE, FINRA, SIPC).  Stifel will serve as TD's clearing broker for select securities.  Client transactions in these securities will be executed in TD's custodial account for the benefit of Canter Wealth and delivered on the settlement date to TD against payment in full by TD on Canter Wealth's client's behalf.  TriVant Custom Portfolio Group Canter Wealth previously maintained a third-party advisory relationship with TriVant Custom Portfolio Group, LLC. As of February 15th, 2018, Canter Wealth and TriVant discontinued this relationship. For any client remaining with TriVant Custom Portfolio Group, LLC, after February 15, 2018, TriVant will pay Canter Wealth 50% of the management fee/revenue share TriVant receives until each remaining client closes their account. TriVant's clients are no longer clients of Canter Wealth; we have discontinued the direct relationship with such clients.   Conflicts Of Interest  Outside of the relationship referenced herein, neither the adviser nor any of its management persons have any other material relationships or conflicts of interest with any financial industry participants. Canter Wealth makes no assurance that the products or the products of another entity are offered at the lowest available cost.  Clients are under no obligation to implement any recommended transaction(s) through any other recommended entity and are not obligated to utilize any of the Canter Companies' services.  Additional details of how Canter Wealth mitigates conflicts of interest can be found in the firm's comprehensive written supervisory Compliance Policies & Procedures Manual and its Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics is available free for review upon request to any client or prospective client."

2010083,"Item 2.C. - Notice filings are provided to Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Colorado due to the remote work status of certain employees of the Adviser.  Item 5.D. ? The Adviser serves as investment adviser to 21 private investment funds; however, 7 of these funds have a single insurance company investor.  In accordance with the Staff?s FAQs on Item 5.D. of Form ADV (posted June 12, 2017), the Adviser has included the insurance company investor for these 7 single-investor funds in row (k).  The other private investment funds are reflected in row (f) because they are not single-investor funds. The Adviser serves as collateral manager for six collateralized loan obligation private funds. A newly formed fund, 720 East CLO VII, LTD., is in warehouse phase as of December 31, 2024, but the placement agent expects to launch this fund on March 31, 2025. Accordingly, we included this fund in our regulatory assets under management and client total.  Item 5.F.(2) ? The Adviser?s clients consist primarily of its parent, The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company (?Northwestern Mutual?), and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Northwestern Mutual enterprise.  As of December 31, 2024, these entities represented approximately $293.5billion of the Adviser?s $299.9billion of regulatory assets under management.   Northwestern Mutual owns interests in certain private investment funds for which NMIMC serves as investment adviser and collateral manager.  In accordance with the instructions for Part 1A, the value of these interests has been included in the assets NMIMC manages on behalf of Northwestern Mutual and in the applicable private funds.     Item 9 - $293.2billion, which represents the amount of assets managed on behalf of Northwestern Mutual and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries within the Northwestern Mutual enterprise, has been excluded from Item 9 in reliance on the SEC staff's position in a prior no-action letter.  See Cigna Capital Advisors, SEC No-Action Letter (September 30, 1985).  Additionally, as noted above with respect to Item 5.D., the Adviser serves as investment adviser to 15 private co-investment funds. For purposes of Item 5.D., in accordance with the Staff?s FAQ cited above, the Adviser has counted the insurance company investor in the single-investor funds as a client, and the funds as clients for the funds that have more than one investor. Certain of those private co-investment funds are audited annually by an independent public accountant and audited financials are distributed to those funds? investors under Section 206(4)-2(b)(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. See the SEC Staff?s FAQs on the Custody Rule, Question VI.11.  The responses to Items 9A. and 9B. both include assets of the 15 private co-investment fund clients referred to above in relation to Item 5.D. With respect to Item 9.A., the general partner of 13 of the 15 private investment funds is a related person of NMIMC and, as indicated in response to Item 7.A., is a SPV that relies on NMIMC?s Form ADV registration in reliance on the staff?s no-action letter ABA Subcommittee of Private Investment Entities (December 8, 2005). With response to Item 9.B., NMIMC may be deemed to have custody of the assets of certain private co-investment fund clients due to the authority of its related person, Northwestern Mutual.      Schedule D, Section 7.A. - Certain related persons have been omitted from Section 7.A. of Schedule D because the Adviser (1) has no business dealings with such related persons in connection with advisory services it provides to clients, (2) does not conduct shared operations with such related persons, (3) does not refer clients or business to the related persons, and the related persons do not refer prospective clients or business to the Adviser, (4) does not share supervised persons or premises with the related persons and (5) has no reason to believe that its relationship with the related persons otherwise creates a conflict of interest with its clients.  A supplementary list of related persons that are in one or more of the categories listed in Section 7.A. will be provided upon request.  The foreign financial regulatory authorities identified in response to Schedule D, Section 7.A., Question 10.(b) for Northwestern Mutual refer to markets in which sub-custodian accounts are open and there is authority to trade in the local market.   720 East CLO 2022-I, LTD.; 720 East CLO 2023-I, LTD.; 720 East CLO 2023-II, LTD.; 720 East CLO IV, LTD.; 720 East CLO V, LTD.; 720 East CLO VI, LTD.; and 720 East CLO VII, LTD. Item 28 - We have endeavored to provide private fund reporting information as accurately as possible with respect to collateralized loan obligation vehicles, even where we feel certain questions are inapplicable or cannot be accurately responded to with the response options provided. For example, beneficial interests in securities issued by these collateralized loan obligation vehicles are traded through a depositary institution that does not provide the adviser with detail on identity or number of beneficial owners. Since questions 13, 15 and 16 in section 7.B(1) do not allow us to leave these items blank, we have responded with 'zero' ('0') but expressly disclaim the answers provided for these questions. In addition, the primary offering of a collateralized loan obligation vehicle is generally conducted through a placement agent, but the activities of the placement agent are not ongoing after the launch of the vehicle. As a result, in question 28 of section 7.B.(1), we have named the placement agent, for collateralized loan obligation vehicles when the primary offering occurred. .  Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) ? The amounts listed for required minimum investment commitments reflect minimums set forth in each private fund?s Form D Notice of Sale of Securities.  Individual commitments of lesser amounts may be accepted at the discretion of the general partner for each fund.  In addition, with respect to the single investor funds described above, the number of beneficial owners for each fund includes a third-party investor, as well as a general partner entity affiliated with the Adviser. Northwestern Mutual Private Equity Co-Investment Fund IV, LP will be subject to an annual audit, however the investment period for this fund commenced on January 1, 2025, and Regulatory Assets Under Management as of December 31, 2024, consisted solely of uncalled capital commitments. Accordingly, this fund did not have an annual audit for year ended December 31, 2024."

Similarly, the calculation of custody assets reported in Item 9 eliminates the duplication of assets in the same manner. The gross assets of each private fund reported in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D is reported in its entirety and is not adjusted to eliminated the duplication of assets.  //  In response to Item 5.E, Compensation Arrangements: Bell Partners, its general partners and affiliates are expected to receive certain supplemental fees and compensation with respect to portfolio investments to the extent permissible under the applicable fund governing documents. Please see Form ADV Part 2A Item 5 for additional information about all fees and compensation received by the firm.  //  In response to Item 6.B.(1), Other Business Activities, Bell Partners has answered ""no"" because the investment manager itself does not participate in any other business activities. However, Bell Partners has affiliates that primarily provide services in the multifamily real estate business, including property management, construction management, interior design, property asset management and development services. Additionally, Bell Partners' affiliates receive reimbursements related to various services provided as more fully discussed in the ADV Part 2A.  //  Various pooled investment vehicle clients qualify for and rely on the exclusion from the definition of ""investment company"" set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  As such, none of these pooled investment vehicles currently constitute a ""private fund"" for purposes of the Advisers Act, Form ADV or Form PF and are therefore not included in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D.  //  Private funds that rely on the Section 3(c)(1) exemption from the definition of an Investment Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 include investors who are not qualified clients because the investors were admitted to the fund prior to Bell Partners' registration with the SEC.  //  Bell Partners has custody of pooled investment vehicle client assets because its related persons serve as the general partner or managing member of the pooled investment vehicles. Cash and securities for which these related persons have custody are included in Item 9.B, which excludes uncalled capital that is included in Regulatory Assets Under Management in Item 5.  //  Bell Partners has established special purpose vehicles to act as the general partner or managing member of its pooled investment vehicle clients. The SPVs have not registered with the Commission in reliance on the positions expressed in the ABA No-Action Letters dated  December 8, 2005, and affirmed in the ABA No-Action Letter dated January 18, 2012."

Centerbridge Flex Partners, L.P. and Centerbridge Flex Partners Cayman, L.P. will invest their investable assets, either directly or indirectly, in Centerbridge Flex Partners Master, L.P. |  ""Type of fund"": Certain private funds identified in ADV Part 1A are closed-end funds that pursue private equity investment strategies that nonetheless are classified as ""hedge funds"" in response to q. 10 in the 7.B.1 Schedule pursuant to the definition of ""hedge fund"" found in the instructions to Form ADV Part 1A and to conform to Form PF classifications. |  Regulatory assets under management (?RAUM?), private fund gross asset values, and the amount of client funds for which Registrant and its related persons have custody are reported as of 12/31/24 (except as otherwise noted herein). Martello Re Limited, a reinsurance vehicle formed by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (?MassMutual?), commenced operations in the 4th quarter of 2021; Centerbridge Martello Advisors, L.L.C. and Barings LLC (which is affiliated with MassMutual but not with Registrant) both provide investment advisory services in a joint-venture arrangement. In the case of the Martello Re structure, assets from SC IV, CB Martello Feeder, L.P., CB Martello Feeder II, L.P., CB Martello SBS, L.P., BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC ? Martello Re Series, BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust ? Martello Re Sub-Trust and BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series II also are reflected in the RAUM attributed to insurance company clients in light of the different nature of the advisory mandates and distinct associated advisory fees payable to the applicable advisers. For purposes of Section 5.K.(1) of Schedule D, Centerbridge is including in the breakdown of asset types those assets custodied by Centerbridge. CB AG Fund, L.P., and Park Blue CLO 2024-VI, Ltd. received commitments and/or commenced or will commence operations as private funds after 12/31/2024, thus for each the gross asset value reported in response to q. 11 in the 7.B.1 Schedule is zero. The assets under management calculation, as expressed in ADV Part 2A, applies a different methodology that results in a figure different from RAUM. |  The 12/ 17/20 Amendment to this Form ADV included changes to reflect the retirement of Mark Gallogly in December 2020. In the case of certain entities, ownership (including capital) of limited partnership interests results in ?Control Person? status in certain sections of Schedule R. Registrant notes that as it relates to disclosures in Schedule A, Vivek Melwani does not have a middle name or middle initial. |  With respect to Item 6, Registrant may from time to time have its employees or other representatives on the boards of directors and/or other committees, or acting in management roles, of certain companies in which one or more private funds are invested. |  With respect to the questions regarding Registrant?s related persons in Item 7, certain companies owned by Registrant?s related persons are, or may become, during the course of the related person?s investment, involved in financial services and/or investment advisory activities, which may include status as broker-dealers, investment companies or other pooled investment vehicles or investment advisers, among other things. Registrant formed collateralized bond obligation (CBO) vehicles Centerbridge Credit Funding 1, Ltd. (?CBO 1?) and Centerbridge Credit Funding II, Ltd. (?CBO II?) and collateralized loan obligation (CLO) vehicles Park Blue CLO 2022-I, Ltd. (?CLO I?), Park Blue CLO 2022-II, Ltd. (?CLO II?), Park Blue CLO 2023-III, Ltd.

(the aforementioned CBO and CLO vehicles, collectively, the ?CDO Vehicles?). As of Registrant?s last Form ADV annual filing, Centerbridge Special Credit III-Flex, L.P. (?SC III-Flex?) owned equity in CBO 1, CBO II and CLO II, and SC IV owned equity in CLO IV and CLO V. Furthermore, after 12/31/24 and prior to the filing date for Registrant?s last Form ADV annual filing, SC IV purchased equity in CLO VI. Centerbridge Credit Funding Advisors, LLC, a relying adviser of Registrant, provides advisory services to the CDO Vehicles, and may in the future provide advisory services to other vehicles that are similar in nature. |  Responses to q. 13 in the 7.B.1 Schedule include where applicable investors who have made capital commitments that have not had capital called. CB AG Fund, L.P., Park Blue CLO 2024-VI, Ltd., Centerbridge Flex Partners Master, L.P., Centerbridge Flex Partners, L.P., Centerbridge Flex Partners Cayman, L.P., Centerbridge FP Co-Invest Fund, L.P. and CB LDV Co-Invest, L.P. - Series A, commenced or will commence operations as private funds after 12/31/24 and, consequently, the calculation of net asset values (?NAV?) for these private funds would have yielded a result that Registrant does not consider to be meaningful; therefore, q. 14 through q. 16 in the 7.B.1 Schedule, which are calculated based on NAV, show zero as responses for such private funds. SC III-Flex was initially the sole investor in the equity of CLO I, CLO II and CLO III, and SC IV was initially the sole investor in the equity of CLO V. As of Registrant?s last Form ADV annual filing, SC III-Flex no longer held equity interests in CLO I and CLO III and was no longer the sole holder of equity interests in CLO II, and SC IV was no longer the sole holder of equity interests in CLO V, both having sold some or all such interests. The sold interests now may trade in secondary market transactions that Registrant does not have visibility into, thus Registrant?s responses to q. 13 through q. 16 in the 7.B.1 Schedule for the CDO Vehicles describe the beneficial ownership of equity interests held, if any, by SC III-Flex or SC IV. The responses in the 7.B.1 Schedule pertaining to BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series, BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust and BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series II are provided in reliance on information provided by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. (?BBH Co?), which Registrant has not itself independently verified. Per BBH Co, BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust is registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA); however, the trust?s sub-trusts, including Martello Re Sub-Trust, are not separately registered with CIMA, therefore Registrant has not listed CIMA in the response to q. 5 in the 7.B.1 Schedule. for BBH Wealth Strategies Unit Trust - Martello Re Sub-Trust. BBH Co intends to have an extended audit period for BBH Wealth Strategies, LLC - Martello Re Series II, from the date of the first capital call on 12/19/24 through 12/31/25. As a result, the first audited financial statements for that fund are not expected to be available until approximately mid-2026. As a result of that extended audit period, the response for that fund to q. 23(h) in the 7.B.1 Schedule. will remain ?Report Not Yet Received? until the completion of the first audit in 2026. |  Registrant is affiliated with Overland Advisors, LLC, with which Registrant has a relationship, including the provision of resources pursuant to a resource sharing agreement. Overland Advisors, LLC has been formed to provide investment advice to a business development company and is a separate investment adviser with its own Form ADV filing (https://adviserinfo.sec.gov/firm/summary/325525). |  This 8/26/25 Amendment was filed to generate PF IDs, as required for Form PF, for the SC V Masters; the SC V Feeders; Centerbridge Special Credit Partners IV - I Co-Invest, L.P. - Series D and Centerbridge Special Credit Partners IV - I Co-Invest, L.P. - Series E, all which are reporting certain data as of 6/30/25. The SC V Feeders had not called capital as of 6/30/25, consequently the calculation of NAV for the SC V Feeders and SC V Masters would have yielded a result that Registrant does not consider to be meaningful; therefore, q. 14 through q. 16 in the 7.B.1 Schedule, which are calculated based on NAV, show zero as responses for such private funds."

2012234,"SCHEDULE B: For federal income taxes purposes Davenport & Company LLC (the ?LLC?) is organized as a limited liability company that is owned by five corporations that have elected to be taxed as S Corporations.  The multiple S Corporations are required due to tax law limitations on the number of permitted shareholders per each S Corporation.  Davenport's Schedule A lists the following five S corporations as direct owners: DAVENPORT & CO. OF VIRGINIA, INC; DAVENPORT CORP;  DAVA CORP; DAVENPORT IV, INC.; AND DAVENPORT FIVE, INC.  While this structure results in 5 direct owners of the membership units of the LLC; the only beneficial owners of the LLC are the shareholders of the S Corporations, all of whom are employees of the LLC.  For voting purposes, each individual shareholder of one of the S Corporation votes his or her shares on any matters with his or her S Corporation which in turn are relayed to the LLC without alteration.  Since the number of LLC membership units exactly equals the aggregate number of outstanding S Corporation shares, each vote by an S Corporation share is also an identical vote by a membership unit in the LLC.  Accordingly, it is our view that when calculating ownership percentages, we look to the ownership percentages of the beneficial owners of the S Corporations in the aggregate.  Thus, while an individual holding shares in a single S Corporation may own 10% of that S Corporation's shares, that same individual may have only 1% of the beneficial ownership of the membership units in the LLC. No individual employee indirectly holds more than 10% of membership interest of the firm.

2008332,"For Schedule D, Section 1.F, Global Infrastructure Management, LLC and its affiliates (?GIM?) maintain a liaison office in Seoul, Korea, and certain private funds maintain a Luxembourg office for regulatory local presence requirements. GIM can provide additional information regarding these locations upon request.  For Item 5, regulatory assets under management reflect the gross aggregate value of the assets held by private funds and separately managed accounts as of year-end plus unfunded capital commitments. GIM forms special purpose vehicles to serve as the general partners or managing members of certain private funds managed by GIM and are together filing a single Form ADV in reliance on the position expressed in the SEC letter addressed to the American Bar Association?s Subcommittee on Private Investment Entities dated October 8, 2005, as updated on January 18, 2012. From time to time, certain private funds and separately managed accounts make investments through alternative investment vehicles and holding companies (collectively ?AIVs?) that GIM forms to facilitate investments for tax, regulatory, or other structuring reasons. The AIVs have not been separately reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), but information regarding the AIVs has been aggregated with the private funds or separately managed accounts to which they relate. Regulatory assets under management and gross asset values are estimated and unaudited and may differ materially from the final audited amounts. Certain entities recently formed or being wound down with gross asset values of zero or near zero as of year-end are not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1). However, committed capital that has not been called by certain such recently formed entities is included in the amount of regulatory assets under management in Item 5 and the information provided in Item 9. In addition, these entities are included the number of clients managed by GIM. Where applicable, regulatory assets under management and gross asset values have been converted from EURO, INR, GBP, and AUD to USD based on the 12/31/2024 Spot Rate.   In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), the total commitment amount for each private fund was used to calculate the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), a private fund?s general partner (or similar managing entity) is not counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13, and the general partner?s commitment amount is excluded when calculating the percentages for the percentages for Questions 14, 15, and 16. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), where applicable, investors in a private fund who have made capital commitments but have not yet had capital called are counted for purposes of the number of beneficial owners in Question 13. In Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), due to the structural overlap of certain private funds, separately managed accounts, and co-investment clients, GIM answered in the negative for Question 19 and indicated zero percent for Question 20 as it believes that such structural overlap does not constitute a solicitation of any such client or investment by any such client into a private fund. For purposes of Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), in response to Question 28, GIM indicated ?Yes? for private funds that are currently in an active fundraising period utilizing a third-party placement agent, and ?No? for private funds that previously employed a third-party placement agent but whose fundraising period has ended. Global Infrastructure Partners Singapore Manager Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIM, is not reported in Schedule D, Section 7.A. This entity is a sub-manager to certain non-US private funds and separately managed accounts and receives management fees from such entities, but does not conduct any investment advisory services. GIP IV Cavalry Co-Invest II, L.P. is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). This entity is an investment-specific vehicle whose sole beneficial owner is Infra Investors II Co-Invest, L.P., a private fund listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). Global Infrastructure Partners IV-C / C2 AIV, L.P. was formed for investment structuring purposes and is not reported in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). However, its beneficial owners are investors in other Global Infrastructure Partners IV private funds, which are listed in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1). For purposes of Item 8.A.(1), from time to time, GIM warehouses investments for certain private funds that have not been formed or have not closed when the investments are made. Once formed, GIM transfers the investments to the respective private funds pursuant to their governing documents. GIM discloses these warehousing arrangements and the corresponding risks to prospective investors within the relevant private placement memoranda. For purposes of Item 8.A.(2), certain of GIM?s principals and employees invest in the same investments as the private funds (including co-investments) through such funds? general partner entities or dedicated ?friends and family? vehicles. Certain private funds and separately managed accounts hold public securities indirectly at Caixa Bank.  For Schedule D, Section 7.A., GIM treats all BLK affiliated SEC-registered investment advisers and exempt reporting advisers as related persons. These advisers manage private funds and separately managed accounts not listed under Item 5.D. or Schedule D, Section 7.B.1. of GIM?s Form ADV. These private funds and separately managed accounts are reported on the respective Form ADVs of each related SEC- registered adviser and exempt reporting adviser.

Oaktree does not consider Brookfield or its affiliates to be its ?advisory affiliates? or ?related persons? for purposes of this Form ADV. For more information regarding Brookfield and its affiliates, please refer to the Form ADV of Brookfield affiliated investment advisers: Brookfield Public Securities Group LLC (CRD# 110497), Brookfield Asset Management Private Institutional Capital Adviser (Credit), LLC (CRD# 170811), Brookfield Asset Management PIC U.S. LLC (CRD# 151599), Brookfield Asset Management PIC BMG, LLC. (CRD# 312797), Brookfield Asset Management Reinsurance Advisor LLC (CRD# 312792) and, Brookfield BHS Advisors LLC (CRD# 309500). Oaktree Capital Group Holdings, L.P. (?OCGH?) holds 100% of the Class B units of OCH which, during the period (the ?Initial Period?, which is more specifically described in the Form 8-K filed October 4, 2019, available through EDGAR) from September 30, 2019 through the date on which Brookfield delivers a written election to end the Initial Period (which election cannot be delivered before September 30, 2026 unless certain events occur before then), entitle OCGH to 10 votes per Class B unit on all matters to be submitted to a vote of the OCH members. In addition, during the Initial Period, the board of directors of OCH is comprised of two individuals selected by OCGH, two selected by Brookfield, and the remaining directors nominated by OCGH and subject to joint written appointment by each of OCGH and Brookfield. As a result, during the Initial Period, OCGH controls OCH and, indirectly, the Registrant, although OCH is prohibited from taking certain actions without the consent of Brookfield. The General Partner of the Limited Partnerships listed in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D has the authority to waive the minimum investment requirement. Some of the Limited Partnerships for which the Registrant acts as General Partner or Investment Adviser are closed-end limited partnerships. As such, clients are not solicited to invest in such closed-end limited partnerships after the final closing has occurred. We have excluded from our disclosure limited partnerships and/or limited liability companies organized and operated solely for the benefit of our employees as well as any special purpose vehicles that were formed in relation to a specific investment or private fund. For certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) of schedule D that are denominated in Euro, the Gross Asset Value and minimum investment commitment values have been converted to USD for purposes of reporting. For all private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value has been rounded to the nearest thousands. For purposes of Item 5: Information About Your Advisory Business ? Regulatory Assets Under Management, Oaktree advises certain funds of funds that invest solely in other private funds advised by Oaktree, as noted in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D. for purposes of calculating Regulatory Assets Under Management as reported in Item 5 and reporting of the Gross Asset Value of private funds in Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the limited partner interests held in the other Oaktree private funds by the funds of funds have been excluded from the Gross Asset Values of such funds of funds. As such, the Gross Asset Value of such funds of funds may be reported as zero in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), if such funds of funds have no other assets other than the limited partner interests in the other Oaktree private funds. In addition, feeder funds are consolidated with the main fund to which they relate for purposes of financial statement reporting. Therefore, for purposes of reporting Gross Asset Values for feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the Gross Asset Value for the feeder fund is included in Gross Asset Value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. For purposes of calculating the gross asset values in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), any uncalled commitment amounts are not included for each relevant private fund. For purposes of reporting beneficial owners, for the feeder funds requiring separate reporting from the main fund in Schedule D, Item 7.B.(1), the number of beneficial owners for the feeder fund is included in the beneficial owner value for the associated main fund and has been reported separately for each such feeder fund. All funds with financial statements subject to an annual audit, listed on Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1), are audited by the same overarching auditing firm; however, in circumstances where the main fund and feeder fund are audited by entities of such auditing firm in separate jurisdictions, the specific entity auditing the feeder is not separately disclosed. The General Partner of certain private funds reported in Section 7.B.(1) may make an investment through an Oaktree or Oaktree affiliate-managed Alternative Investment Vehicle (""AIV""). Each AIV is governed by organizational documents containing provisions substantially similar to those of the fund to which they relate. Investments made through the AIVs are funded by contributions either directly to these entities or contributions to the funds to which they relate that are subsequently transferred to the AIV, such that in both cases investors will directly own a limited partnership interest in the AIV. Financial results for each AIV are reported on a consolidated basis with the fund to which they relate. For certain private funds listed in Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1) that are securitized asset funds, senior noteholders are treated as creditors while the income noteholders (who possess an equity-like claim on fund assets) are treated as beneficial owners of the fund for purposes of Ownership questions 13-16. In addition, for certain securitized asset funds, registrant has responded ?No? to questions 23(G) and (H) due to the fact that such private funds do not obtain unaudited financial statements and thus the questions are not applicable. For certain master funds included in Section 7.B.(1) that are part of master-feeder arrangements, we do not solicit clients to invest at the master fund level and therefore have answered ?No? for Question A.19 of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. However, as the marketing materials and private placement memorandums include information regarding the fund complex as a whole (i.e. the master fund in a master-feeder arrangement appears in such documents along with the relevant feeder funds, even though no investors can invest directly in the master fund and may only invest in the fund complex through a feeder fund), we have answered ?Yes? for Question B.28.(a) of Section 7.B.(1) for those master funds. For any other-than-annual amendment where we are adding private fund(s) to Section 7.B.(1) of Schedule D, the data reported is as of the last day of the prior fiscal quarter month end date. All other responses are as of the last day of the prior fiscal year. Please note that Oaktree Gardens OLP SPV, LP included in Section 7.B.(1) is a feeder fund to the Oaktree Gardens OLP, LLC which is a BDC managed by Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. This feeder fund has been excluded from Regulatory Assets Under Management as those assets are reported in the Regulatory Assets Under Management for Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC. Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC is a relying adviser structured as a limited liability company with multiple series. Identified in Section 4.A.2 of Schedule R are the direct owners of the management series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. The other series of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC hold passive interests that do not confer control over the investment advisory activities of Oaktree CLO Management Company, LLC. Accordingly, the owners of such other series have not been listed as direct owners in Section 4.A.2."

2010694,"Most, if not all, of AmeriFlex??s investment advisory representatives (""IARs"") are concurrently registered as ?registered representatives? of SagePoint Financial, Inc. (?SagePoint?), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC and a registered investment advisory firm (CRD No. 133763) (each a ?Dually Registered Person?). SagePoint is not otherwise affiliated with our firm. Clients can enter into a separate commission-based arrangement with such individuals (but not with AmeriFlex? directly) and SagePoint for securities brokerage services (a ?Brokerage Arrangement?). Investments made through the Brokerage Relationship may be separate from the advisory services we provide to you, and therefore, AmeriFlex? does not have a fiduciary duty over such Brokerage Relationship recommendations.   Under the foregoing arrangement, these Dually Registered Persons, acting in their capacity as registered representatives of SagePoint, may receive commissions, ongoing distribution fees (i.e., trails), and other compensation based on sales of securities to clients. This creates a conflict of interest insofar as such Dually Registered Persons may have a financial incentive to sell securities to clients for which they may collect commissions. Alternatively, they may have an incentive to forego providing you with advisory services when appropriate, and instead recommend the purchase of commissionable investments, if they deem that the payout for recommending the purchase of these investments would be higher than providing management advice on these products for an advisory fee. Clients are advised that fees paid to AmeriFlex? for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the commissions and/or other forms of compensation that may be earned by any Dually Registered Persons for selling securities products to clients through SagePoint.   The receipt of securities related commissions by an individual associated with the firm presents a conflict of interest. As fiduciaries we must act primarily for the benefit of our investment advisory clients. As such, we will only transact securities related business with clients when fully disclosed, suitable, and appropriate.  Further, we must determine in good faith that any commissions paid to our representatives and affiliates are appropriate. Clients are informed that they are under no obligation to use any individual associated with our firm for the purchase of securities products or services. Clients may use any broker-dealer they choose for purchase of these products and services. We encourage you to ask us about the conflicts of interest presented by the dual registration of our IARs.  Certain of our Advisory Affiliates are licensed insurance agencies and/or some of our IARs are independently licensed on an individual basis to sell insurance in one or more states acting as direct agent representatives of a specific insurance company or companies. Insurance related business is transacted with advisory clients and licensed individuals may receive commissions from insurance products sold to clients. Clients are advised that the fees paid to AmeriFlex? for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the commissions earned by any individual (or insurance agency) for selling insurance products to clients. If requested by a client, we will disclose the amount of commissions expected to be paid.   The receipt of insurance related commissions by any individual or Advisory Affiliate associated with AmeriFlex? presents a conflict of interest. As fiduciaries we must act primarily for the benefit of our investment advisory clients. As such, we will only transact insurance related business with clients when fully disclosed, suitable, and appropriate.  Further, we must determine in good faith that any commissions paid to our representatives and affiliates are appropriate. Clients are informed that they are under no obligation to use any individual associated with our firm for the purchase of insurance products or services. Clients may use any insurance firm or agent they choose for purchase of these products and services. We encourage you to ask us about the conflicts of interest presented by the insurance licensure of our Advisory Affiliates and IARs."

This law prohibits Candriam from asking Candriam EOPDs to respond to the majority of questions in Item 11. Even for those questions where Candriam may ask its Candriam EOPDs for their responses, the law prohibits the disclosure of information that otherwise would be provided in the relevant Disclosure Reporting Page of this Form without further safeguards in place for the transfer of personal data."" Schedule D, Section 7.B.(1): The private funds are registered in several jurisdictions. We have listed the primary jurisdictions of regulation only in response to question 5. With respect to question 12 for the funds, there is no minimum investment commitment for the funds in which we answered ""$1,"" therefore the amount invested by investors are under their discretion and can vary significantly between investors. The figures reported in response to question 13 for the private funds are based on information available to Candriam, considering that it has a detailed view on the clients and distributors to which it sells fund interests directly, but has no information on the number of beneficial owners to whom its third party distributors sell its funds in certain non-US markets. Therefore, this approximate number of beneficial owners refers to the number of end investors and non-US distributors invested in the fund with which Candriam has a direct relationship. The figures reported in response to question 15 for the private funds take into account the percentage of the fund owned by Candriam managed funds of funds. Due to the manner in which underlying Candriam funds are distributed and held in markets outside the United States where their shares are sold, however, Candriam is not currently able to provide specific information regarding the percentage of third-party fund of funds that may invest in a given Candriam fund. For the purposes of responding to question 20, Candriam has calculated the figures as a percentage of total clients. Candriam has responded ""no"" to question 28, except for one fund. Except for this one fund, Candriam does not use any third parties to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. However, Candriam enlists several regulated distributors for the purpose of selling the funds in non-US markets in accordance with the requirements of applicable (non-US) regulations. Candriam does not use a website to market the funds in the United States or otherwise to US persons. It understands that distributors located outside the United States are expected to target their marketing efforts exclusively to non-US investors in their home markets. Non US distributors may use websites targeted to investors in non-US jurisdictions for the purpose of distributing shares of Candriam funds.  Form ADV-NR: Candriam is neither a partnership nor an unincorporated business association and thus does not consider itself to be required to File Form ADV-NR in connection with its registration. Candriam has however signed the non-resident adviser execution page, and, as disclosed in Schedule B, it is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of a company organized and operating in the United States. With regard to the information listed in Schedule B, please note that New York Life Insurance Company is a mutual life insurance company and does not have shareholders.

2002179,"In response to Section 7.B.(1), Lowe, Brockenbrough & Company, Inc. (?Brockenbrough?) has provided information for each of the private funds for which it is engaged as the investment advisor. Bespoke Capital Strategies, LP (?BCS?) is a Delaware series limited partnership with seven distinct series in which a limited partner can invest. Six of the seven series are components in mini-master feeder structures, wherein the tax-exempt series serve as feeder funds to the corresponding master taxable series. Please note that because of their role as a master series in this mini-master feeder structure, the assets of taxable series do include the tax-exempt investment as well. Each of the seven series are displayed in Section 7.B.(1) as separate private funds as they each have and maintain separate books and records. Bespoke Private Strategies, LP (?BPS?) is a Delaware series limited partnership with twenty-eight distinct series to which a limited partner can commit capital. These are closed-end structures organized by vintage year that accept, or previously accepted, capital commitments for a designated period of time, before closing to new investors. Each of the twenty-eight aforementioned series are considered feeder funds and are aggregated into one or more master series through which all investments are made. For example, the Bespoke Private Strategies, LP ? Series Taxable 2014 and Bespoke Private Strategies, LP ? Series Tax-Exempt 2014 are feeder funds for the Bespoke Private Strategies, LP ? Series Master 2014. Each of the feeder funds and master funds are listed as separate private funds in Section 7.B.(1). The format of the ADV does not allow for more than one master series to be attributed to a feeder fund. Please note the following series have more than one master series: Series Taxable 2015 (Series Master 2015 and Real Estate Series Master 2015), Series Tax-Exempt 2015 (Series Master 2015 and Real Estate Series Master 2015), Series Taxable 2016 (Series Master 2016 and Real Estate Series Master 2016), Series Tax-Exempt 2016 (Series Master 2016 and Real Estate Series Master 2016), Series Taxable 2019 (Series Master 2019 and Real Estate Series Master 2019), Series Tax-Exempt 2019 (Series Master 2019 and Real Estate Series Master 2019), Series Taxable 2020 (Series Master 2020 and Real Assets Series Master 2020), and Series Tax-Exempt 2020 (Series Master 2020 and Real Assets Series Master 2020), Series Taxable 2022 (Series Master 2022 and Real Asset Series Master 2022), and Series Tax-Exempt 2022 (Series Master 2022 and Real Asset Series Master 2022).   Regulatory Assets Under Management: For purposes of Items 5.D and 5.F, Brockenbrough has separately managed account relationships with certain clients where the client has invested in pooled investment vehicles managed by Brockenbrough. The firm has reported these assets in Item 5.D and 5.F as regulatory assets under management with respect to its relationships as a separately managed account adviser and pooled investment vehicle adviser. This results in redundant accounting of certain assets in the calculation of regulatory assets under management, but provides accurate information about how Brockenbrough manages separately managed accounts in Section 5.K. of Schedule D. Additionally, the assets of the affiliated private funds include $301,977,690 of unfunded commitments. Certain client relationships for whom we have a discretionary investment management agreement have been deemed to be non-discretionary for purposes of calculating regulatory assets under management. In these cases, clients include those for whom we provide recommendations and facilitate the execution of investments on the client?s behalf. Using margin or borrowing is not a part of our investment strategy with respect to separately managed account clients. Certain clients do utilize borrowing or margin. Consistent with the way Brockenbrough reports to these clients, regulatory assets under management reflect the balances net of any margin or borrowing balances."

2007577,"Most, if not all, of AmeriFlex??s investment advisory representatives (""IARs"") are concurrently registered as ?registered representatives? of SagePoint Financial, Inc. (?SagePoint?), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC and a registered investment advisory firm (CRD No. 133763) (each a ?Dually Registered Person?). SagePoint is not otherwise affiliated with our firm. Clients can enter into a separate commission-based arrangement with such individuals (but not with AmeriFlex? directly) and SagePoint for securities brokerage services (a ?Brokerage Arrangement?). Investments made through the Brokerage Relationship may be separate from the advisory services we provide to you, and therefore, AmeriFlex? does not have a fiduciary duty over such Brokerage Relationship recommendations.   Under the foregoing arrangement, these Dually Registered Persons, acting in their capacity as registered representatives of SagePoint, may receive commissions, ongoing distribution fees (i.e., trails), and other compensation based on sales of securities to clients. This creates a conflict of interest insofar as such Dually Registered Persons may have a financial incentive to sell securities to clients for which they may collect commissions. Alternatively, they may have an incentive to forego providing you with advisory services when appropriate, and instead recommend the purchase of commissionable investments, if they deem that the payout for recommending the purchase of these investments would be higher than providing management advice on these products for an advisory fee. Clients are advised that fees paid to AmeriFlex? for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the commissions and/or other forms of compensation that may be earned by any Dually Registered Persons for selling securities products to clients through SagePoint.   The receipt of securities related commissions by an individual associated with the firm presents a conflict of interest. As fiduciaries we must act primarily for the benefit of our investment advisory clients. As such, we will only transact securities related business with clients when fully disclosed, suitable, and appropriate.  Further, we must determine in good faith that any commissions paid to our representatives and affiliates are appropriate. Clients are informed that they are under no obligation to use any individual associated with our firm for the purchase of securities products or services. Clients may use any broker-dealer they choose for purchase of these products and services. We encourage you to ask us about the conflicts of interest presented by the dual registration of our IARs.  Certain of our Advisory Affiliates are licensed insurance agencies and/or some of our IARs are independently licensed on an individual basis to sell insurance in one or more states acting as direct agent representatives of a specific insurance company or companies. Insurance related business is transacted with advisory clients and licensed individuals may receive commissions from insurance products sold to clients. Clients are advised that the fees paid to AmeriFlex? for investment advisory services are separate and distinct from the commissions earned by any individual (or insurance agency) for selling insurance products to clients. If requested by a client, we will disclose the amount of commissions expected to be paid.   The receipt of insurance related commissions by any individual or Advisory Affiliate associated with AmeriFlex? presents a conflict of interest.

2007911,"SCHEDULE B: For federal income taxes purposes Davenport & Company LLC (the ?LLC?) is organized as a limited liability company that is owned by five corporations that have elected to be taxed as S Corporations.  The multiple S Corporations are required due to tax law limitations on the number of permitted shareholders per each S Corporation.  Davenport's Schedule A lists the following five S corporations as direct owners: DAVENPORT & CO. OF VIRGINIA, INC; DAVENPORT CORP;  DAVA CORP; DAVENPORT IV, INC.; AND DAVENPORT FIVE, INC.  While this structure results in 5 direct owners of the membership units of the LLC; the only beneficial owners of the LLC are the shareholders of the S Corporations, all of whom are employees of the LLC.  For voting purposes, each individual shareholder of one of the S Corporation votes his or her shares on any matters with his or her S Corporation which in turn are relayed to the LLC without alteration.  Since the number of LLC membership units exactly equals the aggregate number of outstanding S Corporation shares, each vote by an S Corporation share is also an identical vote by a membership unit in the LLC.  Accordingly, it is our view that when calculating ownership percentages, we look to the ownership percentages of the beneficial owners of the S Corporations in the aggregate.  Thus, while an individual holding shares in a single S Corporation may own 10% of that S Corporation's shares, that same individual may have only 1% of the beneficial ownership of the membership units in the LLC. No individual employee indirectly holds more than 10% of membership interest of the firm.
